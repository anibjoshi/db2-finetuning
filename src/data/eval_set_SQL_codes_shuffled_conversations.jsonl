Objects dependent on the table can be determined by querying the catalog. For views, expression-based indexes, or materialized query tables dependent on the table, query SYSCAT.VIEWDEP, where the table matches the BSCHEMA and BNAME columns. For triggers dependent on the table, query SYSCAT.TRIGDEP, where the table matches the BSCHEMA and BNAME columns. For SQL functions or SQL methods, query SYSCAT.ROUTINEDEP where the table matches the BSCHEMA and BNAME columns. For check constraints on the table, query SYSCAT.CHECKS, where the table matches the TABSCHEMA and TABBNAME columns. For tables with registered spatial columns, unregister the spatial column. For referential constraints dependent on the table, query SYSCAT.REFERENCES, where the table matches the TABSCHEMA and TABNAME columns or the REFTABSCHEMA and REFTABNAME columns. For XSR objects enabled for decomposition for which the table is a target, query SYSCAT.XSROBJECTDEP, where the table matches the BSCHEMA and BNAME columns. If the error pertains to a RENAME COLUMN action of an ALTER TABLE statement, the column cannot be renamed directly while the target table is a history table. The column can be renamed by taking one of the following actions. Determine the name of the system-period temporal table that uses the history table and issue the RENAME COLUMN operation with that name as the target of the ALTER TABLE statement. This renames the column in both the system-period temporal table and the associated history table. Determine the name of the system-period temporal table and issue the DROP VERSIONING operation with that name as the target of ALTER TABLE statement. This changes the history table and the system-period temporal table into a regular tables. You can now rename the column of the table in your original ALTER TABLE statement.

{"input": "How do I resolve SQL1273N?", "output": "Recover the missing log file by taking one of the following actions: Move the specified log file into the database log directory and restart the operation. If an overflow log path can be specified, restart the operation with the overflow log path, specifying the path that contains the log file. If the missing log file cannot be found, determine whether one of the following special cases applies: If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command to maintain a standby system through log shipping, this error might be normal, because some files that are available on the primary site might not yet be available on the standby system. To ensure that your standby system is up-to-date, issue a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the QUERY STATUS option after each rollforward operation to verify that the log replay is progressing properly. If you find that a rollforward operation on the standby system is not making progress over an extended period of time, determine why the log file that is reported as missing is not available on the standby system, and correct the problem. Note that the ARCHIVE LOG command can be used to truncate currently active log files on the primary system, making them eligible for archiving and subsequent replay on the standby system. If a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the TO END OF LOGS option was issued following a restore operation from an online backup image in which the only available logs are those that were included in the backup image, there are two possible scenarios to consider: Scenario 1: All of the log files contained in the backup image are found by the rollforward operation. However, the rollforward operation still looks for log files that were updated following the original backup operation. Bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option). To avoid this scenario in the future, use the END OF BACKUP option instead of the END OF LOGS option, because the rollforward operation will not look for log files that were updated after the backup was taken. Scenario 2: One or more log files that were contained in the backup image were not found by the rollforward operation. These log files are required to bring the database to a consistent state. Attempting to bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option) will fail with SQL1273N; recover the missing log file, as described earlier in this section. If the missing log file cannot be recovered: If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command, you can issue the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command again with the STOP option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option) to bring the database to a consistent state. If this consistency point (immediately prior to the missing log file) is not acceptable, you can restore the database and roll forward to any point in time that is prior to the missing log file by providing an earlier time stamp to the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command. If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP or COMPLETE option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option), the missing log file is needed to bring the database to a consistent state. Because you cannot recover the missing log file, you must restore and roll forward to an earlier point in time (as long as that point in time is not prior to the minimum recovery time). If the operation is a call to the db2ReadLog or db2ReadLogNoConn API for the purpose of replicating data, resynchronize the replicated tables and terminate the current connection being used by the API. If the API is being used to maintain a disaster recovery site, a backup image that was created after the last time stamp in the missing log file must be restored to the disaster recovery site before any subsequent API calls can complete successfully. If the API is being used for any other purpose, terminate the connection being used by the API and deactivate the database. In all cases, restart the scan by creating a new connection to the database and calling the API with the query action. Use the nextStartLRI as the piStartLRI on the next call to the API."}

The operation caused an adjustment to a recorded time value for the period.' indicates: Table table-name is a system-period temporal table. The table includes a period period-name . The requested data change operation was performed and resulted in an adjustment to a recorded time value for the period. This can occur for one of the following reasons: Two transactions are accessing the same row. The transaction that started first has a statement that is updating or deleting the row after a statement in the second transaction has already changed that row. This results in the timestamp value in the row begin column being the start time of the second transaction. The first transaction cannot update or delete a row if the row begin time stamp on that row is later than when the first transaction started. Data has been loaded into the system-period temporal table with values for the row begin column that override the generated values. The row begin column value that was loaded is in the future relative to the timestamp that the executing transaction would use. For an update operation, the adjustment can affect both the begin and end columns for the period. For a delete operation, the adjustment only affects the end column for the period. The statement was processed with an adjustment to the recorded time for the period."}

Check db2diag.log for this position. Use \"db2pd -hadr\" command to get current replay position. 6 Consider the following scenarios when deciding on a suitable response: 6.1) If the HADR primary database is running on a different server, then the database on this server should be started as an HADR standby database. Perform the following steps: Issue the START HADR AS STANDBY command on the database on this server. Verify that this new HADR standby database has established a connection with the HADR primary database by examining the HADR_CONNECT_STATUS field of the db2pd -hadr command or the MON_GET_HADR() table function on the HADR primary database. Note, an ADM12513E message will also be reported in the administration notification log on the HADR primary database if a connection cannot be established. If this new HADR standby database cannot establish a connection to the HADR primary database, then this new HADR standby database will need to be fully reinitialized based on a backup image of the HADR primary database. Please see IBM Db2 Knowledge Center article titled \"Initializing high availability disaster recovery (HADR)\". 6.2) If the HADR primary database is not running on a different server (or cannot be made to run), then the database on this server should be started as an HADR primary database. Perform the following steps: Issue the STOP HADR command on the database on this server. If you wish to establish an HADR standby database on a different server before starting the database on this server as an HADR primary database, then please see IBM Db2 Knowledge Center article titled \"Initializing high availability disaster recovery (HADR)\". Issue the START HADR AS PRIMARY command on the database on this server (or the START HADR AS PRIMARY BY FORCE command if there is no HADR standby database running yet). 7 Reissue the command after the restart of the replay completes. 9 Make sure the UPGRADE DATABASE command is issued on the primary database and wait until the standby database is no longer in upgrade in progress state before reissuing the command. sqlcode : -1776 sqlstate : 08004"}

Verify that the routine library has been deployed to the function directory on all partitions of the database. 5 Possible solutions are ordered to match the causes provided in the message explanation: There can be multiple levels of this indirection involved, leading to this reason code. For example, routine body X can be found, and it requires shared library Y which is also found, however Y needs another shared library Z that cannot be located. The routine library should be relinked or the user should verify that all dependent libraries are available in the LIBPATH (UNIX) or PATH (Windows). Use the db2set command to update the LIBPATH to include the path where the library is located. For example: db2set db2libpath=/db2test/db2inst1/sqll Use a supported library. If a lack of memory is determined then the system configuration may need to be changed to make more memory available to DB2. 8 Ensure that the module is correctly linked. 9 Contact the routine creator or your database administrator to make sure the library containing the function was correctly linked. The system configuration may need to be changed to make more memory available to database server. 15 Verify that the EXTERNAL NAME clause in the routine definition statement contains the full path, or the function exists in the directory called db2_installation_path\\function. If any of these situations is true and the error occurs due to an instance running under an account which cannot access a LAN drive prior to the directory containing your function in the PATH environment variable, you need to reconfigure the DB2 service to run under a user account that has access to all the network paths that are in the PATH environment variable. When assigning a user account to the DB2 service, make sure that the account is granted all the required advanced user rights. 16 Verify that the library-or-path Class referenced in the EXTERNAL NAME clause in the routine definition statement contains a function function-code-id which can be resolved without ambiguity based on the SQL data-types in the routine definition statement. If the routine was defined with PARAMETER STYLE HIVE in the routine definition statement, check the routine implementation for multiple function-code-id methods. For example, if there are multiple function-code-id methods, make sure that no two methods contain the same parameter list when those methods can use either the java.lang.String class or the org.apache.hadoop.io.Text substituted for each other. Other: Note the code, and see your system administrator. Federated system users: if this user defined function is a function template (and thus no code is required to reside on the federated server), you may want to consider modifying the SQL statement or statistics to enable this function to be evaluated on the remote data source. sqlcode : -444 sqlstate : 42724"}

{"input": "What is the recommended response for SQL20058N?", "output": "Respond according to the reason code: 1 Ensure all elements have a name. You can use the AS clause to name expressions, or explicitly name all the columns in the column list of the materialized query table definition. 2 Do not reference unsupported objects. 3 Do not reference unsupported column or expression types. 4 Do not reference unsupported columns, expressions or functions. 5 Create the materialized query table as not replicated. Or correct the statement so the query refers to a single table and does not contain subqueries, aggregation, or the PARTITIONING clause. 6 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or: remove nickname references. remove DISTINCT. remove special registers and built-in functions that depend on the value of a special register. remove the not deterministic function or replace it with a deterministic function. remove all OLAP, sampling, and text functions. remove the aggregate function from the expression or change the expression to be a simple reference to the aggregate function. remove the aggregate functions or add a GROUP BY clause. correct the CREATE TABLE statement to ensure that no recursive common table expression is referenced. remove the subquery. 7 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or: correct the CREATE TABLE statement to ensure all GROUP BY items are in the select list. correct the GROUP BY clause to ensure there are no duplicate grouping sets. remove the nullable column, C, or add GROUPING(C) in the select list. correct the CREATE TABLE statement to ensure at least one unique key from each table referenced in the query appears in the select list. 8 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or: add COUNT(*) or COUNT_BIG(*) to the select list or remove the GROUP BY clause. add COUNT(*) to the select list or remove SUM(C), or alter the column C to be not nullable. remove unsupported aggregate functions or replace them with supported functions. remove the HAVING clause. correct the CREATE TABLE statement to ensure that the GROUP BY clause contains all of the partitioning key columns. 9 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or change the table definition to a subselect or to a UNION ALL in the input table expression of a GROUP BY. 10 Respond to reason code 10 in one of the following ways: If REFRESH IMMEDIATE is specified and the FROM clause used the explicit INNER JOIN syntax, change the FROM clause to reference a single table or replace the explicit INNER JOIN syntax with the implicit inner join syntax. If REFRESH IMMEDIATE was specified, replace it with REFRESH DEFERRED. If MAINTAINED BY REPLICATION was specified, change the FROM clause to reference a single table. 11 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or remove the aggregate functions from the input table of the UNION ALL or JOIN. 12 Create the materialized query table as REFRESH DEFERRED, or reduce the total row width, or number of columns of the MQT. Create a system temporary table space with suitable page size. 13 Ensure that the fullselect does not include a CONNECT BY clause. A hierarchical query cannot be used to create a materialized query table. 14 Rewrite the CREATE TABLE statement so that the select clause does not contain a reference to a base table. 15 Ensure that the column-organized MQT is referencing only column-organized tables or specifies MAINTAINED BY REPLICATION, or specifies ORGANIZE BY COLUMN. Also ensure that a row-organized MQT is referencing only row-organized tables. Then re-issue the statement. 16 Ensure that the statement contains one of the following clauses, then re-issue the statement. MAINTAINED BY USER MAINTAINED BY REPLICATION MAINTAINED BY SYSTEM, with the REFRESH DEFERRED and DISTRIBUTE BY REPLICATION clauses REFRESH DEFERRED, instead of REFRESH IMMEDIATE 17 To create a shadow table on the specified base table, alter the specified base table so that the table is supported as a base table for shadow tables. 18 To create a shadow table on the specified base table, include different columns in the fullselect or ensure that the specified columns satisfy all requirements. 19 Modify the fullselect to satisfy requirements for creating shadow tables. 20 Define the shadow table so that the names of the columns of the shadow table exactly match the names of the selected columns of the base table. sqlcode : -20058 sqlstate : 428EC"}
