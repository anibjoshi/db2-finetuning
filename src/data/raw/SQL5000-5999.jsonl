There is also one database manager configuration file for each client installation, which contains information about the client enabler for a specific workstation. The database manager configuration file is named db2systm and is located in the instance directory. Database configuration file Created when a database is created, the database configuration file contains parameters that affect the use of that database.

This message is returned when a database utility (such as db2start, db2icrt, restore, or many others) requires that the database manager write to or read from either the database manager configuration file or the database configuration file, and the database manager was unable to access the configuration file.

The first transaction cannot update or delete a row if the row begin time stamp on that row is later than when the first transaction started. Data has been loaded into the system-period temporal table with values for the row begin column that override the generated values.
