The operands of a union, intersect, or except operator must contain items that are nodes only. The operands of an arithmetic expression cannot be sequences of length greater than one. The operands of a node comparison must be either single nodes or empty sequences. In general, atomization must not result in more than one atomic value. When atomization is applied to a comparison expression, the result of atomization must be single atomic values, where the value of the first atomized operand is comparable with the value of the second atomized operand.

When (item(), item()+) appears as the value-type , a sequence of 2 or more items is being used in an expression where a single item is expected. The orderspec values in an order by clause must be convertible to a common type. A value that is bound to a variable must match the declared type (if a type is declared). The cast of a value of source type value-type to target type expected-type must be a supported cast. In cases where SQL processing invokes XQuery to perform a cast from an XML data type to an SQL data type other than XML, an XQuery cast is performed with a temporary derived XML schema type that is generated using a name based on the SQL data type and associated size restrictions.
