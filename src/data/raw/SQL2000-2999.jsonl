Issuing RUNSTATS on the table only may result in a situation where the table level statistics are inconsistent with the already existing index level statistics.  Likewise, issuing RUNSTATS for indexes only or during index creation may leave table level statistics in an inconsistent state.  For example, if index level statistics are collected on a particular table and later a significant number of rows is deleted from this table, issuing RUNSTATS on the table only may end up with the table cardinality less than FIRSTKEYCARD which is an inconsistent state.

An error occurred in one of the following situations: Mapping table space IDs between the staging database and the target database. Validating table space IDs provided by the client against the server memory. The mapped table space is not valid. 18 Reason code 18 can be returned for two reasons: An attempt was made to perform a schema transport operation into a database that is configured to disallow non-logged operations. An attempt was made to specify the TRANSPORT INTO clause with the RESTORE command when restoring to a target database that is encrypted with DB2 native encryption. 19 Not all DDL objects in the transportable set can be created on the target database. 20 The specified backup image was created using an online backup operation, and the LOGTARGET parameter was not specified with the RESTORE command. 21 The table spaces and schemas being transported contain partitioned tables, which are not supported with schema transport.", "response": "Based on the reason code, perform the following actions: 1 Ensure that the table space list contains all objects that exist in the schema list and vice versa. See the db2diag log file for the failing object. 2 Respond to reason code 2 by performing the following steps: Identify the columns that are defined as a data type that is not supported with schema transport by reviewing diagnostic details in the db2diag log files. Remove the columns that are unsupported with schema transport by performing one of the following actions: Drop the columns that are of an unsupported data type. Drop the tables containing the columns that are of an unsupported data type. Remove the table spaces and schemas containing the unsupported columns from the list of schemas to be transported. Run the restore operation again. 3 You can perform one of the following actions to resolve the conflict with the table spaces or schemas and re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. Drop or rename the conflicting table spaces on the target database. Drop or rename the table spaces from the source database and create another backup image. Exclude the offending table spaces and schemas from the transportable set. When removing table spaces and schemas, you must ensure the remaining table spaces and schemas define a valid transportable set. 4 Remove the system table spaces from the table space list and re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command again. 5 When re-issuing the RESTORE DATABASE command, you can either specify a non-default staging database name with the STAGE IN option, or wait for other transports to complete to free up a default staging database name. 6 Ensure that the rollforward logs do not include a load copy recovery operation. 7 Add the SYSCATSPACE tablespace to the backup image. 8 Ensure that the database is single node database that is not configured as a partitioned database environment or a DB2 pureScale environment. 9 Select a compatible backup image and re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 10 Check db2diag.log for errors during attempt to increase LSN on target database. 12 Concurrent transport operations against any target database is not supported. Wait until the existing schema transport completes, then re-issue RESTORE DATABASE command. 13 Wait until schema transport completes, then re-issue operations that alter storage paths. Cleanup connections to the target database and drop the staging database. Re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 14 Check db2diag.log for errors during creation of the staging database. Resolve errors, drop the staging database, then re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 15 Check db2diag.log for errors on the target database. Resolve errors, drop the staging database, then re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 16 Check db2diag.log for errors on the staging database. Resolve errors, drop the staging database, then re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 17 Ensure that the transportable set does not contain any objects that have dependency on table spaces outside of the transportable set. For example, an object in the transportable set cannot have an index defined in another table space that is not included in the transportable set. Check db2diag.log for details on the cause of error. Resolve errors, drop the staging database, then re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 18 Specify a target database that allows non-logged operations and that is not encrypted. 19 Some objects might be invalid or some dependencies might not exist. Check db2diag.log for details on the cause of error. Resolve errors, then re-issue the RESTORE DATABASE command. 20 Call the RESTORE command again, specifying the LOGTARGET parameter. 21 Respond to reason code 21 by performing the following steps: Identify the partitioned tables by reviewing diagnostic details in the db2diag log files.
