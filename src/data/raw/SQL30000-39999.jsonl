{"id": "SQL30081N", "message": "A communication error has been detected. Communication protocol being used: protocol . Communication API being used: interface . Location where the error was detected: location . Communication function detecting the error: function . Protocol specific error code(s): rc1 , rc2 , rc3 .", "explanation": "An error has been detected by the communication subsystem. The following is a description of the token values: protocol , location Communication protocol used and information  that uniquely identifies the node that  detected the error. If the location information  is not available at the time that the error  occurred, then the location token  is not filled in. Valid token values are: protocol TCP/IP; location is the IPv4 or IPv6 address. protocol APPC; location is the fully qualified LU name (networkID.LUname). protocol MQ; location is the MQ queue name. protocol SOAP, SSL, SOCKS, HTTP; location is the Internet address in dot notation. interface The application programming interface used to invoke the protocol services in the previous list item.  Valid token values are: SOCKETS, SOCKS, CPI-C, MQI-CLIENT, GSKit, HTTP. function The name of the communication subsystem function that returned the error code or codes. If protocol is TCP/IP, here are descriptions of some common scenarios: Reason codes rc1 , rc2 , rc3 represent: If present, rc1 contains the errno returned by the  TCP/IP function. On Windows, this is a WSA errno. If present, rc2 contains the h_errno value returned by a TCP/IP name resolution function. On Windows, this is a WSA error number. If rc3 is present and contains \"0\", the remote side has  terminated the connection. If the error was received on the  client, then the remote side could be a server or gateway. If  the error was received on the gateway, the remote side could be  the client or server. If protocol = TCP/IP, rc1 =*, rc2 =*, and rc3 =0, possible causes include: The database agent at the server was forced off by the system administrator. A database agent could not be started at the server because a memory limitation was reached on the system. The connection might have been closed by the remote server at the TCP/IP level. The database agent at the server was terminated due to an abnormal termination of a key database manager process. On Windows, if protocol = TCP/IP, function = WSAStartup,  and rc1 = 0, then rc2 contains the Windows Sockets  Specification version level requested by DB2, and rc3 contains  the Windows Sockets Specification version level supported by the Windows  Sockets DLL. Cause: There was a version level mismatch. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = connect, rc1 = ECONNREFUSED/WSAECONNREFUSED, AIX (79), Windows (10061), linux (111), SUN (146), HP (239), the attempt to connect was rejected. Possible causes: The remote database server has not been cataloged correctly  at the client. In a client-gateway-server scenario, ensure  the host entries are cataloged correctly on the gateway. The database manager configuration file at the server has not  been configured properly with the proper communication  parameters. Check that the SVCENAME database manager configuration parameter has been configured properly  with the TCP/IP service name or port number and that the port  number is unique. If database manager configuration parameters  have been updated at the server, the database manager must be  stopped and re-started for the changes to take effect. There  might be a mismatch between the TCP/IP service name or port  number specified on the server and on the client. Ensure the  service name maps to the correct port number by checking the  services file. You can check this by reading the services file  or checking the output from running the command \"netstat -a\". A firewall at the remote database server has prevented the connection from being established. Verify that the firewall is properly configured to accept connection requests from the client. The DB2COMM environment variable at the server does not  specify the communication protocol used  by the client.  Check that TCPIP has been specified. Issue db2set to see  what has already been set. Run the command \"db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP\"  to set the value. The database manager at the server has not been started, or  has not been started successfully, or has gone down. The  server should have returned SQL1063N, and not SQL5043N. If  you set the database manager configuration parameter DIAGLEVEL to 4 using the command \"db2 update dbm cfg using diaglevel 4\" prior to issuing the \"db2start\" command, then the administration notification  log will provide detailed information on which protocols  were started successfully. Check the administration  notification log. The server might be too busy to handle the volume of incoming connections at this time. Network failure, contact your network administrator.  You can try a test using the protocol tester, pctt,  to verify this is not a DB2 problem. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = connect, rc1 = ETIMEDOUT/WSAETIMEDOUT, AIX (78), Windows (10060), linux (110), SUN (145), HP (238), attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made. Possible causes: An incorrect host name or IP address was cataloged in the hostname field of the node directory on the client and/or gateway. The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the connect request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP connect timeout value and/or the DB2TCP_CLIENT_CONTIMEOUT value. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = recv, rc1 = ECONNRESET/WSAECONNRESET, AIX (73), Windows (10054), linux (104), SUN (131), HP (232), the connection was reset by the remote side executing a \"hard\" or \"abortive\" close. Possible causes: The connection might have been closed by the remote gateway or  server at the TCP/IP level (eg. firewall problem, power failure,  network failure). Client side connection pooling is enabled and is not handling connection failures. Code the application to retry a connection if a failure is received when connecting to the database and connection pooling is enabled. Might have been caused by a thread timeout on the host machine. Check the  system log on the host for the presence of the IDTHTOIN message.  Adjust the setting if applicable. If this cannot be adjusted, either  disable connection pooling on the gateway, or ensure all objects  are properly closed (eg. cursors with hold when the application  completes its operation). The database agent at the server was forced off by the database administrator. The database agent at the server was terminated due to an abnormal termination of a key database manager process. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = recv, rc1 = ETIMEDOUT/WSAETIMEDOUT, AIX (78), Windows (10060), linux (110), SUN (145), HP (238), the connection was dropped because the remote system failed to respond. Possible causes: SQLCancel() was called from a CLI application because the application  set the Query Timeout value or there was an explicit cancel request.  Adjust the Query Timeout value set by the application. If this is  not possible, adjust the QueryTimeoutInterval setting in the  db2cli.ini file. Use QueryTimeoutInterval=0 (no timeout) in the  db2cli.ini file to test whether QueryTimeout is the cause of your  application's failure. The failure of an existing connection is  expected in this scenario. The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the recv request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP recv timeout value. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = selectForConnectTimeout, rc1 = EINPROGRESS/0, AIX (55), Windows (0), linux (115), SUN (150), HP (245), the connect request timed out before it could complete successfully. Possible causes: Either the system connect timeout or the timeout value set by DB2TCP_CLIENT_CONTIMEOUT caused the timeout. Try adjusting these values. If protocol = TCP/IP, function = selectForRecvTimeout, rc1 is irrelevant, the recv request timed out before it could complete successfully. Possible causes: Either the system recv timeout or the timeout value set by DB2TCP_CLIENT_RCVTIMEOUT caused the timeout.  Try adjusting these values. If protocol is APPC rc1 contains the return code from the CPI-C function. If present, rc2 contains the global errno value from the CPI-C function call. rc3 is not applicable. If protocol is MQ rc1 contains the function completion code, 1 for a warning and 2 for an error. rc2 contains the MQ-specific error code. rc3 is not used for MQ.

Some typical examples: The client sent a new password value to a server that does not support the change password function. The client sent SERVER_ENCRYPT authentication information to a server that does not support password encryption. Authentication type catalog information must be the same at the server and the client. The client sent a userid (but no password) to a server that does not support authentication by  userid only. The client has not specified an authentication type, and the server has not responded with a supported type. This might include the server returning multiple types from which the client is unable to choose. The CLIENT AUTHENTICATION type is not supported by \"IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI\" and \"IBM Data Server Driver package\" 18 (NAMED PIPE ACCESS DENIED) The named pipe is inaccessible due to a security violation. 19 (USERID DISABLED or RESTRICTED) The userid has been disabled, or the userid has been restricted from accessing the operating environment at this time. 20 (MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION FAILED) The server being contacted failed to pass a mutual authentication check.

For example, on AIX, no user licenses may have been available. 24 (USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD INVALID) The username specified, password specified, or both, are invalid. Some specific causes are: If you have recently changed permissions on DB2 critical files such as db2ckpw or moved to a new Fixpak, the db2iupdt command which updates the instance might not have been run. The username being used might be in an invalid format. For example, on UNIX and Linux platforms, usernames must be all be lowercase. An error might have been made in specifying the catalog information. For example, the correct authentication type might not have been specified or, if applicable, the remote server might not have been cataloged on the local system. 25 (CONNECTION DISALLOWED) The security plugin has disallowed the connection. 26 (UNEXPECTED SERVER ERROR) The server security plugin encountered an unexpected error.

{"id": "SQL30090N", "message": "Operation invalid for application execution environment.  Reason code = reason-code .", "explanation": "The operation is invalid for the application execution environment. For example, an operation might be invalid for applications that have special restrictions on statements or APIs - applications such as those that operate in an XA Distributed Transaction Processing environment, such as CICS; those that operate with CONNECT type 2 connection settings; or those that use federated system functionality to update multiple heterogeneous data sources. The operation was rejected. Possible reason codes are: 01 an SQL request that changes data (such as an INSERT or a CREATE) was issued against a read-only database; or, a stored procedure was invoked against a read-only database. Read-only databases include the following types: Databases accessed using DRDA when operating in a unit of work which has connection setting SYNCPOINT TWOPHASE and executing in a non-XA/DTP environment when either a Synchpoint Manager is not being used or the remote DRDA database does not support level 2 DRDA protocol. Databases accessed by DRDA in an XA/DTP environment when either a Synchpoint Manager gateway is unavailable or the remote DRDA database does not support level 2 DRDA protocol. Databases which were not the first database updated when the SYNCPOINT ONEPHASE connection setting is in effect for the unit of work. 02 an API such as Precompile, Bind, or Reorganize Table which causes internal commits was issued in an application which has the setting CONNECT type 2 or is operating in an XA/DTP environment. 03 an SQL OPEN for a held cursor was issued while in an XA/DTP environment when using an ENCINA or TUXEDO transaction processing monitor. 04 a DISCONNECT statement was issued while in an XA/DTP environment. 05 A compound SQL statement which contains a COMMIT statement was issued in a CONNECT type 2 or XA/DTP environment. 06 The SET CLIENT API was issued in an XA/DTP environment. 07 A second database is being accessed within a unit of work for which two-phase commit coordination is not being supplied by the transaction manager.  To ensure data integrity, the operation has been disallowed. 08 An attempt was made to access a database for use of commit coordination from a source different from a concurrently connected database.  The two types of coordination cannot be mixed, and operations against the current database are rejected. 09 An attempt was made to execute an XA/DTP local transaction against a database accessed under Synchpoint Manager coordination. 10 An SQL OPEN for a held cursor was issued in either of these cases: XA/DTP environment, or federated server accessing a nickname defined on a two phase commit datasource Cursor hold is not supported in these environments. 11 An operation is not supported for pass-through. 12 The insert/update/delete operation requires the existence of a timestamp column and a unique index due to the restriction on thedata source . For an update/delete operation accessing data sources: Fujitsu RDB2 requires the existence of a unique index. 13 A positioned UPDATE or DELETE operation requires the existence of a column in the SELECT list of the cursor, but that column does not exist in the SELECT list of the cursor. 14 An illegal combination of updatable cursors, cursor hold, and isolation level of Repeatable Read exists.  Invalid combinations are: Isolation level Repeatable Read and a WITH HOLD cursor A WITH HOLD cursor with FOR UPDATE 15 Reserved for future use 16 Illegal type column and protocol column value combination in SYSCAT.SERVERS. 17 The REORG utility cannot be issued against a nickname. 18 An update request (or, a DDL operation that results in the update of a system catalog table) has been issued that would result in multiple data sources being updated when one or more of the data sources in the unit of work only supports one-phase commit.  Possible causes are: An attempt was made to update a data source that only supports one-phase commit, but a different data source has already been updated in the same unit of work. An attempt was made to update a data source that supports two-phase commit, but a different data source that only supports one-phase commit has already been updated in the same unit of work. An attempt was made to update a local federated server table, but a data source that only supports one-phase commit has already been updated in the same unit of work. An attempt was made to update a data source that only supports one-phase commit when the application is operating with a CONNECT type 2 connection setting. 19 The application host variable data type is not supported by the data source in a pass-through session. 20 SET CLIENT INFORMATION was issued while a Unit of Work is in progress. 21 The operation that you want performed at the specified data sources is not supported by the wrapper by which DB2 accesses the data sources.  Consult the documentation to find out what operations this wrapper supports. 22 A federated insert, update, or delete operation, or a call to federated procedure with an SQL data access indication of MODIFIES SQL DATA  is invalid in a function, a data-change-table-reference, a dynamic compound statement, a trigger, and an application execution environment where a SAVEPOINT is in effect scrollable cursor is used target view contains multiple tables or nicknames 23 The API, data structure, or setting is not supported. 24 Data type mappings are not supported by the specified wrapper. 25 Function mappings are not supported by the specified wrapper. 26 In a trusted connection the application can switch the trusted userid only after the commit/rollback has been processed. 27 Use of multiple 2-phase commit servers of the same wrapper library in the same connection where the client library restricts such usage 28 Mix of 1-phase commit server and 2-phase commit server of the same wrapper library in the same connection where the client library restricts such usage 29 An application attempted to issue a switch user request from within a stored procedure. 31 The CREATE WRAPPER statement failed because the DB2LIBPATH environment variable does not contain the path of the client library, and the database manager failed to automatically add that client library path to the DB2LIBPATH environment variable. 32 Federation doesn't support multiple transaction branches of loosely coupled transaction.", "response": "Correct the problem by doing one of the following steps: For reasons 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 19, or 29, remove the statement or API which is not supported. Alternately, for reasons 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, or 29, execute the application in a different environment which supports the failing statement or API. For reason 05, move the COMMIT request outside of the compound statement. For reason 07, ensure that only one database is accessed within a unit of work for which EXEC SQL COMMIT or EXEC SQL ROLLBACK will be issued in place of syncpoint requests to an external transaction manager.  If multiple databases must be accessed within the unit of work, utilize the commitment control interface provided by the external transaction manager product. For reason 08, ensure that all databases being accessed within a unit of work are under the commitment control of the same type of request: external transaction processing monitor (such as CICS SYNCPOINT) or local COMMIT and ROLLBACK EXEC SQL. For reason 09, do one of the following steps: Execute the transaction as an XA/DTP global transaction. Access the database in a non-XA/DTP environment. Do not use the services of the Synchpoint Manager for the database connection if the transaction is read-only. For reasons 10 through 17 (federated server users), isolate the problem to the data source failing the request and examine the restrictions for that data source.

If multiple data sources need to be updated within a unit of work, make sure the db2_two_phase_commit server option has been set to 'Y' for all the data sources that need to be updated. If the data source to be updated supports only one-phase commit and the application is operating with a CONNECT type 2 connection setting, change the application to operate with a CONNECT type 1 connection setting. For reason 20, submit a Commit or Rollback before invoking the API. For reason 22, Either remove the federated insert, update or delete operation, or the call to the federated procedure with  an SQL data access indication of  MODIFIES SQL DATA or: execute the federated insert, update, or delete operation outside of the function, the data-chagne-table-reference, they dynamic compound statement or trigger execute the call to the federated procedure with  an SQL data access indication of  MODIFIES  SQL DATA outside of the function, the dynamic compound statement or trigger release the savepoint that is in effect remove the use of the scrollable cursor redefine the target view to refer to only one table or nickname execute the federated insert, update, or delete operation outside  of the trigger. For reason 23, Use only supported APIs, data structures, and settings. For reason 24, If the failing statement was CREATE TYPE MAPPING, do not resubmit the statement. If the failing statement was CREATE SERVER, examine the federation catalog for type mappings for the server type and drop these mappings. In either case, consult the data source documentation for information about types and type mappings supported by the data source. For reason code 25, If the failing statement was CREATE FUNCTIONMAPPING, do not resubmit the statement. If the failing statement was CREATE SERVER, examine the federation catalog for function mappings for the server type and drop these mappings. In either case, consult the data source documentation for information about functions and function mappings supported by the data source. For reason code 26, Ensure that the trusted userid is not switched during a transaction. For reason code 27, An application cannot access multiple 2-phase commit servers of this data source in the same connection. Execute the application in a different environment. For reason code 28, An application cannot access 1-phase commit server while a connection to 2-phase commit server is active, or vice versa. Execute the application in a different environment. For reason code 31, Perform the following steps: Manually add the path of the client library for the new wrapper to the DB2LIBPATH environment variable. Restart the database manager. Execute the CREATE WRAPPER statement again. For reason code 32, Use tightly coupled transaction instead if Federation nickname is referenced in one of the branch of a global transaction.
