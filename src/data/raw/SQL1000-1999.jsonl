Authorization is performed using DB2 facilities (using DB2 tables and configuration files.)  This message can be returned when there is a problem with either authentication or authorization. Troubleshooting authentication and authorization problems is complicated by the fact that multiple agents are controlling access at different levels (local operating system login credentials, Windows user groups, domains, third-party security services such as Kerberos, the context in which a command is executed, DB2 authority levels, and database objects, just to name a few.) Here are some common scenarios, listed by operating environment, in which this message can be returned: Windows operating systems using groups Here is a description of a scenario in which this message could be returned in a Windows environment using groups: DB2 database configuration: The database product was installed with the database manager instance user set to the Windows LocalSystem account (or set to another local Windows account.) The DB2_GRP_LOOKUP environment variable is not set. Action that fails: A user attempts to connect to a database using a two-part user ID that is defined at a remote domain. Reason for the failure: Because the environment variable DB2_GRP_LOOKUP is not set, the database manager attempts to enumerate the groups at the location where the user ID is defined.  However, because the database manager is running under the context of the LocalSystem account, the database manager does not have authority to access the network to enumerate the groups at the location where the user ID is defined. Windows operating systems using Kerberos In a Windows environment in which Kerberos authentication is being used, this message can be returned when an attempt is made to log on to a computer with an account that is not a domain account.

The error condition can be detected by the federated server or by the data source. A database manager agent was unavailable The database manager was stopped or had not been started on the database server. An administrator forced a database agent off the system. A database manager process terminated abnormally. The user ID had insufficient authority The user ID was forced off of the system when another user with SYSADM authority issued a FORCE QUIESCE command. The FORCE QUIESCE command forces off of the system all users who do not have CONNECT QUIESCE authority for the database or instance or who do not belong to a group that has CONNECT QUIESCE authority. In Windows operating system environments: Extended Security was enabled, and the user ID was not a member of the DB2USERS or DBADMINS group. Database directory conflicts There were two databases, one local and one remote, with the same database name and same database alias. A local database was cataloged as a remote database. After a change was made to the way that one or more databases were cataloged, the changes did not take effect because the database manager is still using a cached copy of the database cataloging information. A configured database limit or a system resource limit was reached The application was using more transaction log space than allowed by the max_log database configuration parameter or the num_log_span database configuration parameter. There were insufficient coordinator agents to process the application requests. Applications that hold locks in WITH HOLD cursors and are queued for execution in concentrator mode might cause active agents to be held up waiting for those locks. The connection was idle for longer than the time specified in the CONNECTIONIDLETIME threshold. A unit of work on the connection lasted longer than the time specified in the UOWTOTALTIME threshold and the connection was terminated because the threshold action specified FORCE APPLICATION.

Database activation on a newly added member If the first activation of a database on a newly added member is in progress, a subsequent database connection attempt on the newly added member will fail until the first activation is complete.", "response": "Reconnect to the database. If the connection continues to fail, perform the following troubleshooting steps with the assistance of a database administrator: Federated environments only: Determine whether it is a federated data source that is returning the error or the federated database server that is returning the error. Ensure that client/server configuration is correct: Confirm whether the communication subsystem (including network cables, network cards, and communication protocols such as TCP/IP) is up and running. In client/server environments using the TCP/IP protocol: Assign the same port number to the TCP/IP service name on the client as the port number on the server. Ensure the database manager is up and running: Determine whether the database manager is up and running. Review the db2diag log files for evidence that a database manager process was interrupted or terminated abnormally. If the database manager is stopped, or if there is evidence in the diagnostic logs of any database manager agents being interrupted or terminating abnormally, restart the database manager. Ensure that the user ID has authority: If the database or instance was quiesced, take one of the following actions: Unquiesce the database or instance. Add the user ID to the group that has CONNECT QUIESCE authority. In Windows operating system environments: If Extended Security is enabled, add the appropriate user ID to the local Windows security group DB2USERS or DB2ADMNS. Remove any database directory conflicts: Compare the contents of the local database directory and the system catalog to the database configuration.  In particular, look for the following problems: Ensure that no two databases have the same name or alias as each other. Ensure that local database are cataloged as local, and that any remote databases are cataloged as remote. After making any changes to the ways databases have been cataloged, stop and restart the database manager instance. Make necessary configuration and application changes to avoid exceeding database or operating system limits: Determine which limit was exceeded by reviewing db2diag log files, and then make one or more of the following changes: Reduce the chance of applications being forced off for using too much transaction log space by make one or more of the following changes: Alter the application to issue more frequent commit statements. Increase the max_log database configuration parameter or the num_log_span database configuration parameter. Reduce the chance of applications being forced off because there are insufficient coordinator agents by make one or more of the following changes: Increase the value of max_coordagents relative to the value of max_connections. Reduce the use of WITH HOLD cursors. Reduce the chance of connections being closed for being idle for too long by increasing the CONNECTIONIDLETIME threshold. Reduce the chance of connections being closed because a unit of work is taking too long to execute by increasing the UOWTOTALTIME threshold. Reduce the chance of queries timing out by increasing the SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute or using the QueryTimeoutInterval CLI/ODBC configuration keyword. In AIX, 32-bit environments: reduce the chance of running out of AIX shared memory by making one or more of the following changes: Catalog the database as a loopback data source using TCP/IP. If the application is using multiple contexts with local protocol, then either reduce the number of connections in the application, or switch to another protocol, such as TCP/IP. Set the EXTSHM parameter if the application supports the EXTSHM parameter and if there are sufficient memory resources to use the parameter. Alter the application as needed to avoid unsupported usage scenarios: To avoid connecting to a DB2 member that is in restart light mode, either specify a member that is not in restart light mode, or do not specify any specific member and allow the database manager to route the connection to an appropriate member. For DB2 for z/OS servers: collect server diagnostics, such as a z/OS SVC dump, for the application identifier that is reported as the connection correlation token (CRRTKN) and the logical unit of work ID (LUWID) in the z/OS diagnostic messages. In a DB2 pureScale environment, if a new member has been added you must wait for the activation operation to complete until you open subsequent connections to the database from the new member.

If the operation was a rollforward operation, the operation has stopped and the database is left in rollforward pending state.", "response": "Recover the missing log file by taking one of the following actions: Move the specified log file into the database log directory and restart the operation. If an overflow log path can be specified, restart the operation with the overflow log path, specifying the path that contains the log file. If the missing log file cannot be found, determine whether one of the following special cases applies: If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command to maintain a standby system through log shipping, this error might be normal, because some files that are available on the primary site might not yet be available on the standby system. To ensure that your standby system is up-to-date, issue a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the QUERY STATUS option after each rollforward operation to verify that the log replay is progressing properly. If you find that a rollforward operation on the standby system is not making progress over an extended period of time, determine why the log file that is reported as missing is not available on the standby system, and correct the problem. Note that the ARCHIVE LOG command can be used to truncate currently active log files on the primary system, making them eligible for archiving and subsequent replay on the standby system. If a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the TO END OF LOGS option was issued following a restore operation from an online backup image in which the only available logs are those that were included in the backup image, there are two possible scenarios to consider: Scenario 1: All of the log files contained in the backup image are found by the rollforward operation. However, the rollforward operation still looks for log files that were updated following the original backup operation. Bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option). To avoid this scenario in the future, use the END OF BACKUP option instead of the END OF LOGS option, because the rollforward operation will not look for log files that were updated after the backup was taken. Scenario 2: One or more log files that were contained in the backup image were not found by the rollforward operation. These log files are required to bring the database to a consistent state. Attempting to bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option) will fail with SQL1273N; recover the missing log file, as described earlier in this section. If the missing log file cannot be recovered: If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command, you can issue the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command again with the STOP option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option) to bring the database to a consistent state. If this consistency point (immediately prior to the missing log file) is not acceptable, you can restore the database and roll forward to any point in time that is prior to the missing log file by providing an earlier time stamp to the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command. If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP or COMPLETE option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option), the missing log file is needed to bring the database to a consistent state. Because you cannot recover the missing log file, you must restore and roll forward to an earlier point in time (as long as that point in time is not prior to the minimum recovery time). If the operation is a call to the db2ReadLog or db2ReadLogNoConn API for the purpose of replicating data, resynchronize the replicated tables and terminate the current connection being used by the API. If the API is being used to maintain a disaster recovery site, a backup image that was created after the last time stamp in the missing log file must be restored to the disaster recovery site before any subsequent API calls can complete successfully. If the API is being used for any other purpose, terminate the connection being used by the API and deactivate the database. In all cases, restart the scan by creating a new connection to the database and calling the API with the query action.

In a redirected restore, the state of each container of a non-automatic storage table space being restored is set to \"storage must be defined\".  This makes it possible to use the SET TABLESPACE CONTAINERS command or API against the containers to redefine their storage. For table spaces using automatic storage, the only way to redefine container paths is to use the SET STOGROUP PATHS command for a specific storage group or the ON keyword when you issue the RESTORE DATABASE command to redefine all the storage groups paths.

A trigger whose execution is potentially dependent on rounding mode could produce different results now, based on the new rounding mode.

Similarly it is possible for constraints that did not allow data to be inserted into a table, would now, with the new rounding mode, accept that same data. The value of a generated column whose calculation is dependent on DECFLT_ROUNDING could be different for two rows identical except for the generated column value, if one row was inserted before the change to DECFLT_ROUNDING and the other was inserted after.

A setuid program executes with the privileges of the owner of the program, instead of the privileges of the user than ran the program.  For example, database manager programs such as the db2start program are owned by root, and therefore executes with root privileges regardless of what the privileges are of the user who runs the db2start command. The ability of programs to run with setuid privileges on a mounted file system is configured using the nosuid option when the file system is mounted.  Mounting a file system with the nosuid option prevents programs from running with setuid privileges.

To avoid a potential split-brain scenario, the primary database will not be started if it cannot establish a connection to the standby database. If the old standby database is already running as a primary, consider starting the old primary database as a new standby database. Issue START HADR DATABASE ON dbname AS STANDBY to convert the old primary database into a new standby database. Or alternatively, reinitialize the old primary database into a new standby database via a backup image of the new primary database. If there was no forced takeover (aka failover) operation on the standby database and the standby database is not running as a primary or standalone database, then check the hadr status and configuration. Ensure that the standby database is online and started as a standby database (use 'db2pd -db dbname -hadr' or MON_GET_HADR). Confirm that the hadr_target_list, hadr_local_host, hadr_local_svc, hadr_remote_inst, hadr_remote_host, hadr_remote_svc database configuration parameters are set correctly on both the primary and standby database. Ensure that the network is functioning, and the primary and standby host can reach each other via TCP/IP (consider using the system 'ping' utility to ping the remote host and svc/port). Examine the db2diag.log files for other error messages that indicate there are incompatible configuration settings on the primary database and the standby database. Ensure that the value of the hadr_timeout configuration parameter is the same on both the primary database and the standby database. Ensure that the value of the hadr_peer_window configuration parameter is the same on both the primary database and the standby database. Ensure the hadr_timeout configuration parameter is set to a value for sufficient time for a connection and handshake to be established between the primary and standby database. If the standby database is offline and cannot be started (due to a standby system failure or other disaster), then force start the primary database. Issue START HADR DATABASE ON dbname AS PRIMARY BY FORCE on the primary database. Or alternatively, issue STOP HADR command on the primary database. 8 Ensure that the following HADR database configuration parameters have a non-NULL value where required: hadr_local_host hadr_local_svc hadr_remote_host hadr_remote_svc hadr_remote_inst hadr_target_list You can determine the current value of these HADR configuration parameters by using the GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION command. 9 Reconfigure the database to use only file system storage for the log files, instead of using raw I/O (direct disk access) devices. 10 Address the cause of the HADR shutdown, and if desired, reissue the START HADR command. 11 Ensure that the hadr_local_host, hadr_remote_host, and hadr_target_list configuration parameters are in the same IP format (IPv4 or IPv6) or can be resolved to the same format. 12 Ensure that the hadr_remote_host configuration parameter can be mapped to an IPv4 or IPv6 address. 13 Ensure that the dbheap configuration parameter is configured properly and that the system has sufficient memory available for the size of the buffer pool defined. Then retry the operation. If you need to change the size of a buffer pool on the HADR standby, you need to perform a new database restore operation using a backup image from the primary database that includes the new buffer pool size. 14 Ensure that the hadr_target_list configuration parameter has an entry for the pair specified by the hadr_remote_host and hadr_remote_svc configuration parameters. 15 Ensure that all of the entries specified by the hadr_target_list configuration parameter are valid host:service pairs. 16 Ensure that the entries for the hadr_target_list configuration parameter are in the correct format. 17 Either set the hadr_replay_delay configuration parameter to 0 or change the hadr_syncmode configuration parameter to SUPERASYNC. 18 Ensure the hadr_replay_delay configuration parameter is set to 0 on the HADR primary database. 19 Determine which database should be the primary. Drop the other primary database or try converting it to a standby. If both should be primary, they should be removed from each other's hadr_target_list, so that they are independent. 20 Set the hadr_syncmode database configuration parameter to either ASYNC or SUPERASYNC. 21 Update the value specified by either the hadr_local_svc or the svcename configuration parameter so that the TCP port used by hadr_local_svc is not in the port range (inclusively) of svcename and svcename + 1. 22 Update the hadr_local_svc database configuration parameter or the system service names so that the TCP port used by hadr_local_svc is not between (inclusively) the ports defined by service name DB2_instance and DB2_instance_END, where 'instance' is the name of the database manager instance.  To update system service names, on Unix platforms, edit the /etc/services file; on Windows, edit %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\services. 23 Update the hadr_local_svc database configuration parameter or the system service names so that the TCP port used by hadr_local_svc is not between (inclusively) the ports defined by the following pairs of service names: DB2CA_instance_CMD and DB2CA_instance_CMD_END DB2CA_instance_NOTIFY and DB2CA_instance_NOTIFY_END DB2CA_instance_MGMT and DB2CA_instance_MGMT_END In these service names, 'instance' represents the name of the database manager instance.  To update system service names, on Unix platforms, edit the /etc/services file; on Windows, edit %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\services. 24 Check that DB2 registry variable DB2_HADR_SOSNDBUF is set properly. It should not exceed available memory or system level socket buffer size limit. 25 Check that DB2 registry variable DB2_HADR_SORCVBUF is set properly. It should not exceed available memory or system level socket buffer size limit. 26 Refer to db2diag.log to identify the table space that is not available. Resolve the root cause and ensure the storage for the table space is available.  If required, recover the affected table space using the RESTORE DATABASE or ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command. Otherwise, you can drop the table space if it is no longer needed. 27 Set the hadr_peer_window database configuration parameter to 0 in a DB2 pureScale environment. 28 Ensure that the database configuration parameter HADR_SSL_LABEL and the database manager configuration parameters SSL_SVR_KEYDB, SSL_SVR_STASH, and SSL_CIPHERSPECS are set to valid values. After updating the SSL_SVR_KEYDB, SSL_SVR_STASH, or SSL_CIPHERSPECS configuration parameter, stop and restart the database manager. 29 Either change hadr_syncmode database configuration to SYNC or NEARSYNC, or disable automated failover via db2haicu if TSA is used as cluster manager. 97 Check the db2diag.log message and follow the instructions to fix any issues. 98 Obtain and install a valid HADR license and resubmit the command. 99 If the problem persists, contact IBM Support.", "version": "12.1"}

An alternative is to use the BY FORCE option of the TAKEOVER HADR command to perform a failover. The BY FORCE option will allow takeover in broader conditions, but may result in data loss and will not change the primary into a standby. 2 Wait for the log streams to finish local catchup, and then retry the takeover operation. 3 Allow the standby more time to reach the end of the online backup and reissue the command. 4 This command is not supported on a standard or HADR primary database. Issue the command on an HADR standby database only. 5 Activate the standby database, then issue the takeover command. 6 Refer to the database logs on both HADR database partitions for possible causes of this message. The roles of the database partitions may not have changed. Check the value of the hadr_db_role database configuration parameter on both database partitions. 7 Refer to the database logs on both HADR databases for possible causes of this message. You can determine this by checking the value of the hadr_db_role configuration parameter. It is possible that there was a problem executing the role switch. If the roles of the databases have not changed, reissue the TAKEOVER HADR command on the standby. If the roles of both databases are STANDBY, issue the TAKEOVER HADR command with the BY FORCE option on the database that you want to become the primary. 8 Wait for the conflicting command to complete, or for the database to shut down in the case of an internal error. Check the HADR role of the primary and standby databases. Start the databases and retry the takeover if you still want to perform that operation. 9 To force the standby database to takeover outside a peer window, reissue the TAKEOVER HADR command  without the PEER WINDOW ONLY parameter.  Although forcing the standby database to takeover outside a peer window is supported, the risk of transaction loss is greater when the takeover happens outside a peer window. If your primary database failed and you do not want to force the standby database to take over outside a peer window because of the risk of data or transaction loss, consider alternative responses to the failure of the primary database than a forced takeover. In a high availability solution with a primary database and a standby database, a common strategy for responding to the failure of the primary database is to have the standby database take over database operations for the failed primary database.  However, there are other strategies for responding to a failure of the primary database, including repairing and restarting the failed primary database instead of failing over to a standby database.  Although this repair and restart strategy would have a larger negative impact on the availability of the database solution for user applications than the failover strategy, it has other strengths such as less risk of data or transaction loss. 10 Review the cluster manager diagnostic information to determine the error that the cluster manager returned. If possible, repair the cause of the cluster manager error and run the TAKEOVER command again. 11 Disable replay delay by setting the hadr_replay_delay configuration parameter to 0, and reissue the TAKEOVER HADR command. 12 Wait for the members to finish member crash recovery, and then retry the takeover operation. 15 If there is no immediate need to connect to this database, wait for the UPGRADE DATABASE command to complete on the primary database, allow the standby database time to replay all upgrade log records sent from the primary database, and then reissue the command.
