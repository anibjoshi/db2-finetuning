You must stop the database manager to update the db2nodes.cfg file with nodes that have been added to the system since the previous stop database manager command. 21 Ensure that the value specified for the tablespace type is within the valid range. 22 Ensure that the tablespace value specified is defined in the db2nodes.cfg and is between 0 and 999. 23 Specify the computer name of the system on which the new member is created using the COMPUTER option. 24 Specify a valid domain account user name and password for the new member using the USER and PASSWORD options. 25 Resubmit the command with a valid computer name. 26 Resubmit the command with a valid user name. 27 Resubmit the command with a valid password. 28 Change/update the account password and resubmit the command. 29 Resubmit the command with a valid user account. 31 Ensure that the length of the cluster interconnect netname is not longer than SQL_HOSTNAME_SZ. 32 Correct the problem that caused the cluster manager call to fail and resubmit the command: Review the db2diag log file for error messages from the cluster manager. Respond to the cluster manager error messages in the db2diag log file to correct the underlying problem that prevented the cluster manager from removing the path from its configuration. Resubmit the START or STOP DATABASE MANAGER command. 33 Ensure that the identifier matches the type defined in the db2nodes.cfg file in the sqllib directory  when issuing this command with either the MEMBER or CF option. 34 Ensure that the value specified for the QUIESCE option is within the valid range. 35 Resubmit the command with the member parameter specified. 36 No action is necessary in order to fix the topology.  To view the current topology of the DB2 pureScale instance, perform the following steps: Query the topology of the instance using the following command: db2instance -list Copy to clipboard If db2iupdt -fixtopology was issued after an add or drop operation, start the instance using the db2start command. 37 Resubmit the command, specifying a different netname. Ensure that the transport type for the netname specified, as defined in the db2nodes.cfg file, matches the transport type used by existing members and CFs. 38 Respond to reason code 38 by performing the following troubleshooting steps: Identify the RDMA problems that are preventing the start operation from succeeding, using available diagnostic information in DB2 database logs (such as the db2diag diagnostic log files) and system logs. Troubleshoot and resolve the source of the RDMA errors. Perform the start operation again. 39 Ensure the value of CF_NUM_CONNS is valid for the number of members in the cluster and resubmit the command. If CF_NUM_CONNS is set to a fixed value, it might need to be reduced in order for all members to be able to connect to the CF. 40 Run the add member command on a host that is part of the DB2 pureScale cluster. 41 Respond to reason code 41 in one of the following ways: To perform an online add member operation, stop the CF on the target host machine before performing the add member operation. If all CFs are on the target host machine, stop the database manager instance and then add the member to that host machine. 42 Determine which DB2 member or CF failed to start, and then correct the /proc file system directory on the host machine on which that member or CF is located. 43 Stop member(s) on the target host machine and retry the add CF operation. 44 Ensure that the port range specified for DB2_FIREWALL_PORT_RANGE is greater than 2000 ports and is a valid range (between 1024-65535). In environments using a Storage Scale file system, ensure that the range specified for DB2_FIREWALL_PORT_RANGE does not collide with the tscCmdPortRange for the Storage Scale cluster.
