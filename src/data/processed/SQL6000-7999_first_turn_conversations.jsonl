Perform the start operation again. 39 Ensure the value of CF_NUM_CONNS is valid for the number of members in the cluster and resubmit the command. If CF_NUM_CONNS is set to a fixed value, it might need to be reduced in order for all members to be able to connect to the CF. 40 Run the add member command on a host that is part of the DB2 pureScale cluster. 41 Respond to reason code 41 in one of the following ways: To perform an online add member operation, stop the CF on the target host machine before performing the add member operation. If all CFs are on the target host machine, stop the database manager instance and then add the member to that host machine. 42 Determine which DB2 member or CF failed to start, and then correct the /proc file system directory on the host machine on which that member or CF is located. 43 Stop member(s) on the target host machine and retry the add CF operation. 44 Ensure that the port range specified for DB2_FIREWALL_PORT_RANGE is greater than 2000 ports and is a valid range (between 1024-65535). In environments using a Storage Scale file system, ensure that the range specified for DB2_FIREWALL_PORT_RANGE does not collide with the tscCmdPortRange for the Storage Scale cluster.
