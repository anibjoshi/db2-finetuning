If you are upgrading an instance or a database, the release number of the database or database manager is not supported for upgrade. You must upgrade to a release level that is supported for upgrade prior to upgrading to the release number of your Db2 copy. If you are updating an instance or database, the release number of the database is not supported for update. You must update the release level of the database to a level that is supported for update prior to updating to the release number of your Db2 copy. If the error occurred with the sample database, drop it and recreate it using the db2sampl command. sqlcode : -5030 sqlstate : 58031"}]}

See the deprecation statement for the C++ I/O Engine (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJT_5.0.3/com.ibm.swg.im.bigsql.doc/doc/deprecated.html). For further assistance, contact IBM Support. 4 Rerun the statement. If the error continues, consider cancelling existing long running applications with SYSHADOOP.CANCEL_APPLICATION stored procedure or the FORCE APPLICATION CLP command. 5 Rerun the statement. If the error persists, consider cancelling existing long running applications with SYSHADOOP.CANCEL_APPLICATION stored procedure or the FORCE APPLICATION CLP command. sqlcode : -5199 sqlstate : 57067"}]}
