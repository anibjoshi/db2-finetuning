For reason codes 4, 5, 6 and 11 the characteristics of neither the source or target table can be easily modified for compatibility. (For reason code 5, source-tablename is partitioned, so it must have exactly one visible (neither attached or detached) data partition.) In cases where it is difficult to modify the characteristics of either the source or target table for compatibility, create a new table that is compatible with the target table, and copy the data from source-tablename to this new table. 1 You can add columns to the table which is missing one or more columns using the statement: ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT ... Copy to clipboard Make sure that the default value of the added column is the same as the default value of the column in the table where the column already exists. Query SYSCAT.COLUMNS.IMPLICITVALUE for the column in the table where the column already exists. If the value is not NULL, then use the default clause of the ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN statement to set the default value to match the value in SYSCAT.COLUMNS.IMPLICITVALUE. Note: You can only add columns after the last existing column of the table. If the missing column is not the last column, create a new source table. Alternatively, you can drop a column from the table that has the extra column: ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN ....

APPEND OFF Copy to clipboard 4 Create a new source table. 5 Detach data partitions from the source table until there is a single visible data partition using the statement: ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION Copy to clipboard Include any necessary set integrity statements. Otherwise, create a new source table. 6 Create a new source table that is not one of the disallowed types. 7 Determine the correct table to use as the source or target table. 8 Either make the table which is not logged initially be logged by issuing the COMMIT statement, or make the table which is logged be not logged initially by entering the statement: ALTER TABLE ....

ADD DISTRIBUTION (key-specification) Copy to clipboard 11 Create a new source table which matches the target table with respect to the ORGANIZE BY DIMENSIONS clause. 15 The two tables must be protected using the same security policy, have the same column defined as type SYSPROC.DB2SECURITYLABEL, and have the same set of protected columns. 16 Use ALTER TABLE tablename COMPRESS [YES | NO], to ensure that the COMPRESS attributes of the source and target table match. 17 To find the list of indexes on the target partitioned table that do not have a compatible index on the source table, see the administration notification log.

There are several methods you can use to update the XML record format of a table. Either of the following two methods updates the XML record format of a table: Perform an online table move on table using the ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE procedure. Perform the following steps: Use the EXPORT command to create a copy of the table data. Use the TRUNCATE statement to delete all the rows from the table and release the storage allocated to the table. Use the LOAD command to add the data into the table. 20 Ensure the table to attach to has the required access controls or deactivate the access controls on the table being attached. 21 Ensure the table to attach to has the required access controls or deactivate the access controls on the table being attached. 22 Respond to reason code 22 in one of the following ways: If the source table does not have a BUSINESS_TIME period defined, alter the columns in the source that correspond to the BUSINESS_TIME period columns in the target table by using the ALTER TABLE statement with the ADD PERIOD BUSINESS_TIME action on the source table.
