The reason codes are: 1 The NUM_FLUSHERS_PER_PARTITION configuration parameter was set to 0, so there is only 1 flusher for all partitions. 2 The target table is a type that does not have a distribution key. 3 At least one of the distribution key columns has a type that is a user-defined type (UDT) or a DB2SECURITYLABEL. 4 If the SQL statement is INSERT or REPLACE, the column list does not specify all the distribution key columns.
