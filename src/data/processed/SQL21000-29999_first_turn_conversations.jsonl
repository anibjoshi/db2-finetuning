This message is returned when the export utility is unable to export all of the information for one or more tables, which means that the output file that the export utility created would not be able to be used by the import utility to create or recreate the tables. The reason code indicates the type of information that was not exported: 1 Index information has not been saved because the index column names contain hexadecimal values of 0x2B or 0x2D. 2 XML column definitions have not been saved. 3 Multidimensional clustered table (MDC) key definitions have not been saved. 4 Table partitioning key definitions have not been saved. 5 Index names have been truncated due to code page conversion. 6 Information about protected tables has not been saved. 7 Action strings other than 'SELECT * FROM <TABLE-NAME>' have not been saved. 8 Column names specified with the METHOD N parameter were not used because the METHOD N parameter is not supported when hierarchical data is being exported. 9 A column name that was too long for the Integration Exchange Format (IXF) format has been truncated. 10 A user-defined type name that was too long for the IXF format has been truncated. 11 Typed table information has been truncated due to codepage conversion. 12 The name of a schema that is associated with a user-defined type was too long for the IXF format. The schema name has been truncated. 13 Decimal floating-point column definitions have not been saved. 14 Hidden columns information has not been saved. 15 Information about indexes with random ordering was not saved. 16 Table column orientation in column-organized tables has not been saved. 17 Information about expression-based indexes 18 Indexes created with the BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS clause have not been saved. 19 Information about columns where STRINGUNITS has been specified as CODEUNITS32 has not been saved. 20 BINARY or VARBINARY column definitions have not been saved. 21 Information that the table was created as a random distribution table was not saved. 22 Information that the table was created with row modification tracking enabled was not saved."}]}
