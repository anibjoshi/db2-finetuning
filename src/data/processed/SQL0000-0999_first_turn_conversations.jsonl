For a Unicode database, a common cause of this could be that the start or length for a UTF-8 string are incorrect. A scalar function such as TRANSLATE has may have changed the multi-byte string. Federated system users: this situation can also be detected by the data source."}]}

{"dialogue": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I resolve SQL0270N?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The action corresponding to the reason code is as follows: 1 Correct the CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE or CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement. 2 Do not attempt to update the distribution key columns for a multipartition table, or consider deleting and then inserting the row with the new values in the distribution columns. 3 Make the distribution key column not nullable, specify a different ON DELETE action, or change the distribution key of the table so that the foreign key does not include any columns of the distribution key. 4 Either specify DATA CAPTURE NONE or ensure that the table is placed in a table space in a single-partition database partition group that specifies the catalog partition. 5 Do not use the WITH CHECK OPTION clause, or remove the function or view from the view definition. 6 Transforms are automatic for user-defined distinct types. Use the CREATE TRANSFORM statement for user-defined structured types only. 7 Use a table space with a 4 KB page size for any table that includes long fields. If you are using DMS table spaces, you can place long fields in a table space with a 4 KB page size with other table or index data in table spaces with a different page size. When defining a LARGE TABLESPACE, use PAGESIZE 4K. 8 For servers prior to DB2 UDB Version 7.1, ensure that no column data types are structured types in the CREATE TABLE statement or ALTER TYPE ADD COLUMN statement. Ensure that no attribute data types are structured types in the CREATE TYPE statement or ALTER TYPE ADD ATTRIBUTE statement. 9 Do not define triggers on typed tables. 10 Either reduce the row size or number of columns in the table or specify two table spaces such that the long data is in a table space with a 4 KB page size and the base data is in a table space with an 8 KB page size. 11 When creating a typed table or typed view, specify a structured type that has at least one attribute defined. 12 For the type of a source key parameter, use only a user-defined structured type or a distinct type that is not sourced on a LOB, XML, LONG VARCHAR, or LONG VARGRAPHIC type. 13 In a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement for a typed table, do not specify check constraints. In a CREATE VIEW statement for a typed view, do not specify the WITH CHECK OPTION clause. 14 Do not specify referential constraints involving typed tables in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement. 15 Do not specify a DEFAULT clause for a column with a reference data type in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement. 16 For servers prior to DB2 UDB Version 7.1, do not specify a structured type parameter or returns type when creating a user-defined function. Otherwise, do not specify a scoped reference type as a parameter or returns type. Do not specify a structured type as a return column of a table or row function. 17 Do not specify a typed table in the SET INTEGRITY statement. 18 Do not include specific column names when granting REFERENCES or UPDATE privileges on a typed table, typed view, or nickname. 19 Include a specific value when specifying the DEFAULT clause on a column of a typed table. 20 Drop the materialized query table, and re-create it with the desired attributes. 21 To drop or alter a column in a table that is a base table for a materialized query table, perform the following steps: Drop the dependent materialized query table. Drop the column of the base table, or alter the length, data type, nullability, or hidden attribute of this column. Re-create the materialized query table. 22 Issue the CREATE SUMMARY TABLE statement outside of the CREATE SCHEMA statement. 23 Either remove the REPLICATED specification or ensure that REFRESH DEFERRED is specified for the materialized query table definition. 24 Remove the reference to the materialized query table in the triggered-action in the BEFORE trigger. 25 Issue separate SET INTEGRITY IMMEDIATE CHECKED statements for each materialized query table. 26 Drop all replicated materialized query tables in the database partition group, and then issue the REDISTRIBUTE DATABASE PARTITION GROUP command again. Re-create the replicated materialized query tables. 27 Ensure that a subset of the columns defined for the materialized query table also is the set of columns that make up a unique index on the base table. 28 You can change a typed table or materialized query table name only by dropping the table and creating it again with the new name. Dropping the table might have implications on other objects that depend on the table, and the privileges on the table are lost. 29 Remove the FOR EXCEPTION clause from the SET INTEGRITY statement. 30 Issue the CREATE statement for the typed view or typed table outside of the CREATE SCHEMA statement. 31 Reduce the number of columns in the distribution key. 32 Either specify NO LINK CONTROL for the DATALINK column or place the table in a table space on a single-partitioned database partition group that specifies the catalog partition. If you are redistributing data to a multiple-partition database partition group, you must drop the table to continue with the redistribute. 33 Use one of the following approaches: Do not define a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL) on an underlying table of a materialized query table defined with REFRESH IMMEDIATE as the child. Do not define a REFRESH IMMEDIATE materialized query table whose underlying table is the child of a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL). 34 Remove the use of any unsupported object relational features. 35 Do not create or remove the GENERATED [ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT] AS IDENTITY ... attribute. 36 Drop the new node or nodes to go back to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, drop the sequences or tables with identity columns before adding new nodes. 38 An index using an index extension cannot be created on a table in a multiple partition database partition group. A database partition group cannot become a multiple partition database partition group while an index using an index extension exists on a table in the database partition group. Either drop any such indexes and add the partition to the database partition group, in which case the indexes cannot be re-created, or leave the database partition group unchanged. 39 Remove the reference to a nickname or OLE DB table function, or remove the reference to the object that indirectly references one of these. 40 Remove the invocation of the IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL function from the trigger definition or the SQL function definition. 41 Split the assignment into two separate statements. One statement must assign values only to SQL variables, and the other statement must assign values only to transition variables. 42 Drop the new node or nodes to return to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, you must drop the triggers, functions, or methods containing control statements. 43 Reissue the RUNSTATS command and turn off the unsupported option. 44 You cannot use these EXPLAIN modes in SMP, MPP, and Data Joiner environments. If possible, run the query in serial mode. Otherwise, set the EXPLAIN mode to YES or EXPLAIN to provide the same information except for the actual cardinalities. 45 Do not specify the APPEND clause in an ALTER TABLE statement for multi-dimensionally clustered (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 46 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 47 Do not specify the EXTENSION clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 48 Drop the multidimensional clustering (MDC) table and re-create it with the modified dimension specification. 49 Do not specify the CLUSTER clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 50 Do not specify the ORGANIZE BY clause in a CREATE TABLE statement for declared global temporary tables. 51 Issue the CREATE INDEX statement from the catalog database partition. 52 Do not modify the expression or add it to an existing column. To change the composition of the PARTITIONING KEY clause, the ORGANIZE BY clause, the PARTITION BY clause, the DISTRIBUTE BY clause, or the generating expression of any of its members that are generated columns, drop and re-create the table and then repopulate it. 53 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not include a column with these types. 54 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 55 Turn off concentrator or federated database system support. Turn off the concentrator by setting the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_CONNECTIONS to be less than or equal to the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_COORDAGENTS. Turn off federated database system support by setting the FEDERATED parameter in the database manager configuration to NO. 56 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 57 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 58 For a Version 8 database: Input the XML data to one of the functions that accept XML input (ultimately XMLSERIALIZE) and store the output of the function in the database or return it to the application. 59 In a partitioned database environment, only use functions and methods defined with the NO SQL option. 60 Drop the views that depend on the typed table. Reissue the ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET INLINE LENGTH statement for the typed table, and re-create the views that you dropped. 61 Do not use the text search function in the expression for check constraints or generated columns. Use the LIKE function instead of CONTAINS, if possible. 62 Do not specify the WITH CHECK OPTION clause for this view. 63 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not include a column with these types. 64 Do not attempt federated processing on this platform. 65 Do not attempt to alter the nickname local type from the current type to the specified type. 66 Do not specify SYSSTRUCT as a transform group. 67 Do not specify a nickname or a view on nicknames as a target in a MERGE or UPDATE statement. 68 Reduce the number of distinct NEXT VALUE expressions in the statement, or change to a non-partitioned database. 69 Do not use DELETE FROM view-name. 70 Disable the views enabled for query optimization, drop or alter the column of the base table and then enable the views for query optimization. 71 In a partitioned database environment, do not use the CALL statement in a trigger, an SQL function, an SQL method, or a dynamic compound statement. 72 The column cannot become an identity column while it is nullable. To make this change, the table must be dropped and re-created with a not null column and then repopulated. Adding a new column as the identity column might also be considered. 73 Issue the BACKUP command without specifying the INCLUDE LOGS option. 74 Update the status field in the recovery history file by EID only. 75 Use one of the following approaches: Disable automatic statistics profiling for this database by setting the database configuration parameters AUTO_STATS_PROF and AUTO_PROF_UPD to OFF. Change the system to one that is on a single database partition, that does not have SMP enabled, and that is not federated. 83 If both DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and COMPRESS YES are being specified, you must only specify one of them. If one of DATA CAPTURE CHANGES or COMPRESS YES is being specified, you must not specify it as the other is already in effect on the table. 87 Create the table as a non-partitioned table. 89 Use the REORG INDEXES ALL command to reorganize all indexes on the table or data partition. 90 Create a nonpartitioned index by using the default or by explicitly specifying NOT PARTITIONED on CREATE INDEX. 91 Do not specify DATA CAPTURE CHANGES for this table. 92 Drop the referential constraint by using the following statement: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard DROP CONSTRAINT ... Copy to clipboard Alternatively, alter the child table in the foreign key relationship so that the foreign key constraint is not enforced: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... NOT ENFORCED Copy to clipboard Note: The failing detach statement was executed from the parent table in the foreign key constraint, while the constraint enforcement is executed on the child table. These two tables are distinct unless the foreign key constraint is self-referential. Next, resubmit the ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION statement. You can now alter the child table to enforce the foreign key constraint: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... ENFORCED Copy to clipboard This will recheck the tables to ensure that the foreign key relationship is still being enforced. 93 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option to maintain the dependent materialized query tables or dependent staging tables with respect to the data that was appended using LOAD INSERT. 95 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED or IMMEDIATE UNCHECKED option on the table to verify the integrity of the attached partition. 97 Do not alter the column data type. 98 Drop the identity attribute, alter the type, and then re-enable the identity attribute. 99 Drop the check constraint, and then re-issue the ALTER statement. 102 Do not add a security policy to a typed table. 103 On database servers Version 9.5 and earlier, reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW READ ACCESS or ALLOW NO ACCESS. 104 Remove the INPLACE option and reissue the REORG TABLE command. 105 Reissue the REORG INDEX command specifying CLEANUP, or RECLAIM EXTENT, or issue REORG INDEXES ALL to reorganize all indexes (including the block indexes) for the table. 106 Issue the ALTER TABLE statement to drop the materialized query attribute from the table before attempting to attach a partition to the table. 109 Modify the query to place the text search function in a sub-select that directly references the partitioned table that contains the text index and that does not contain an OUTER JOIN clause. 110 Provide a string constant for the security policy name parameter. 111 Do not associate an audit policy with a typed table. 112 Do not try to configure actions or notifications for the health monitor on non-root installations. 113 If possible, define the trigger or function using a compound SQL (inlined) statement, or remove the trigger or function definition. 114 Create the spatial index as a nonpartitioned index by using the NOT PARTITIONED clause on the CREATE INDEX statement. 115 Record the privileges granted to the function in SYSCAT.ROUTINEAUTH, drop the function, recreate the function, and then grant the privileges to the function. 116 Give each named parameter marker in a compound SQL (compiled) statement that is dynamically prepared or executed a unique name. 119 Assign the ARRAY field to an ARRAY variable. 120 No response required. Inserting into this type of table is not currently supported. 121 Do not include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 122 Include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 123 To disable automatic reorg recompress, contact IBM Support. 124 Issue the statement or operation at a non-catalog member. 125 Follow the documented process for applying catalog format changes to this database. 126 Do not include the system hidden columns in the index or constraint. 127 Ensure that the SET TENANT statement is not executed inside a routine. 128 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 129 Set registry variable DB2_BLOCK_REORG_PENDING to OFF and issue the ALTER TABLE statement. The table will be in reorg pending until REORG TABLE with the CLASSIC option is performed against the table. 130 If possible, define the BEFORE trigger using a compound SQL (inlined) statement. 131 Refer to the Db2 documentation for any limitation on the requested function to determine which one is relevant. 132 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 133 Ensure that the source database level and target database level are the same. 134 If the DATA CAPTURE CHANGES clause is not needed, remove it from the SQL statement. Otherwise, set registry variable DB2_CDE_DCC to a boolean true value (TRUE, T, YES, Y, ON, or 1). After changing the registry variable, deactivate and reactivate the database. 135 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify either ALLOW READ ACCESS or ALLOW NO ACCESS. 136 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify ALLOW NO ACCESS. sqlcode : -270 sqlstate : 42997"}]}

Dropping the table might have implications on other objects that depend on the table, and the privileges on the table are lost. 29 Remove the FOR EXCEPTION clause from the SET INTEGRITY statement. 30 Issue the CREATE statement for the typed view or typed table outside of the CREATE SCHEMA statement. 31 Reduce the number of columns in the distribution key. 32 Either specify NO LINK CONTROL for the DATALINK column or place the table in a table space on a single-partitioned database partition group that specifies the catalog partition. If you are redistributing data to a multiple-partition database partition group, you must drop the table to continue with the redistribute. 33 Use one of the following approaches: Do not define a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL) on an underlying table of a materialized query table defined with REFRESH IMMEDIATE as the child. Do not define a REFRESH IMMEDIATE materialized query table whose underlying table is the child of a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL). 34 Remove the use of any unsupported object relational features. 35 Do not create or remove the GENERATED [ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT] AS IDENTITY ... attribute. 36 Drop the new node or nodes to go back to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, drop the sequences or tables with identity columns before adding new nodes. 38 An index using an index extension cannot be created on a table in a multiple partition database partition group. A database partition group cannot become a multiple partition database partition group while an index using an index extension exists on a table in the database partition group. Either drop any such indexes and add the partition to the database partition group, in which case the indexes cannot be re-created, or leave the database partition group unchanged. 39 Remove the reference to a nickname or OLE DB table function, or remove the reference to the object that indirectly references one of these. 40 Remove the invocation of the IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL function from the trigger definition or the SQL function definition. 41 Split the assignment into two separate statements. One statement must assign values only to SQL variables, and the other statement must assign values only to transition variables. 42 Drop the new node or nodes to return to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, you must drop the triggers, functions, or methods containing control statements. 43 Reissue the RUNSTATS command and turn off the unsupported option. 44 You cannot use these EXPLAIN modes in SMP, MPP, and Data Joiner environments. If possible, run the query in serial mode. Otherwise, set the EXPLAIN mode to YES or EXPLAIN to provide the same information except for the actual cardinalities. 45 Do not specify the APPEND clause in an ALTER TABLE statement for multi-dimensionally clustered (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 46 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 47 Do not specify the EXTENSION clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 48 Drop the multidimensional clustering (MDC) table and re-create it with the modified dimension specification. 49 Do not specify the CLUSTER clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 50 Do not specify the ORGANIZE BY clause in a CREATE TABLE statement for declared global temporary tables. 51 Issue the CREATE INDEX statement from the catalog database partition. 52 Do not modify the expression or add it to an existing column. To change the composition of the PARTITIONING KEY clause, the ORGANIZE BY clause, the PARTITION BY clause, the DISTRIBUTE BY clause, or the generating expression of any of its members that are generated columns, drop and re-create the table and then repopulate it. 53 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not include a column with these types. 54 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 55 Turn off concentrator or federated database system support. Turn off the concentrator by setting the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_CONNECTIONS to be less than or equal to the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_COORDAGENTS. Turn off federated database system support by setting the FEDERATED parameter in the database manager configuration to NO. 56 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 57 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 58 For a Version 8 database: Input the XML data to one of the functions that accept XML input (ultimately XMLSERIALIZE) and store the output of the function in the database or return it to the application. 59 In a partitioned database environment, only use functions and methods defined with the NO SQL option. 60 Drop the views that depend on the typed table. Reissue the ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET INLINE LENGTH statement for the typed table, and re-create the views that you dropped. 61 Do not use the text search function in the expression for check constraints or generated columns. Use the LIKE function instead of CONTAINS, if possible. 62 Do not specify the WITH CHECK OPTION clause for this view. 63 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not include a column with these types. 64 Do not attempt federated processing on this platform. 65 Do not attempt to alter the nickname local type from the current type to the specified type. 66 Do not specify SYSSTRUCT as a transform group. 67 Do not specify a nickname or a view on nicknames as a target in a MERGE or UPDATE statement. 68 Reduce the number of distinct NEXT VALUE expressions in the statement, or change to a non-partitioned database. 69 Do not use DELETE FROM view-name. 70 Disable the views enabled for query optimization, drop or alter the column of the base table and then enable the views for query optimization. 71 In a partitioned database environment, do not use the CALL statement in a trigger, an SQL function, an SQL method, or a dynamic compound statement. 72 The column cannot become an identity column while it is nullable. To make this change, the table must be dropped and re-created with a not null column and then repopulated. Adding a new column as the identity column might also be considered. 73 Issue the BACKUP command without specifying the INCLUDE LOGS option. 74 Update the status field in the recovery history file by EID only. 75 Use one of the following approaches: Disable automatic statistics profiling for this database by setting the database configuration parameters AUTO_STATS_PROF and AUTO_PROF_UPD to OFF. Change the system to one that is on a single database partition, that does not have SMP enabled, and that is not federated. 83 If both DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and COMPRESS YES are being specified, you must only specify one of them. If one of DATA CAPTURE CHANGES or COMPRESS YES is being specified, you must not specify it as the other is already in effect on the table. 87 Create the table as a non-partitioned table. 89 Use the REORG INDEXES ALL command to reorganize all indexes on the table or data partition. 90 Create a nonpartitioned index by using the default or by explicitly specifying NOT PARTITIONED on CREATE INDEX. 91 Do not specify DATA CAPTURE CHANGES for this table. 92 Drop the referential constraint by using the following statement: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard DROP CONSTRAINT ... Copy to clipboard Alternatively, alter the child table in the foreign key relationship so that the foreign key constraint is not enforced: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... NOT ENFORCED Copy to clipboard Note: The failing detach statement was executed from the parent table in the foreign key constraint, while the constraint enforcement is executed on the child table. These two tables are distinct unless the foreign key constraint is self-referential. Next, resubmit the ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION statement. You can now alter the child table to enforce the foreign key constraint: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... ENFORCED Copy to clipboard This will recheck the tables to ensure that the foreign key relationship is still being enforced. 93 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option to maintain the dependent materialized query tables or dependent staging tables with respect to the data that was appended using LOAD INSERT. 95 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED or IMMEDIATE UNCHECKED option on the table to verify the integrity of the attached partition. 97 Do not alter the column data type. 98 Drop the identity attribute, alter the type, and then re-enable the identity attribute. 99 Drop the check constraint, and then re-issue the ALTER statement. 102 Do not add a security policy to a typed table. 103 On database servers Version 9.5 and earlier, reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW READ ACCESS or ALLOW NO ACCESS. 104 Remove the INPLACE option and reissue the REORG TABLE command. 105 Reissue the REORG INDEX command specifying CLEANUP, or RECLAIM EXTENT, or issue REORG INDEXES ALL to reorganize all indexes (including the block indexes) for the table. 106 Issue the ALTER TABLE statement to drop the materialized query attribute from the table before attempting to attach a partition to the table. 109 Modify the query to place the text search function in a sub-select that directly references the partitioned table that contains the text index and that does not contain an OUTER JOIN clause. 110 Provide a string constant for the security policy name parameter. 111 Do not associate an audit policy with a typed table. 112 Do not try to configure actions or notifications for the health monitor on non-root installations. 113 If possible, define the trigger or function using a compound SQL (inlined) statement, or remove the trigger or function definition. 114 Create the spatial index as a nonpartitioned index by using the NOT PARTITIONED clause on the CREATE INDEX statement. 115 Record the privileges granted to the function in SYSCAT.ROUTINEAUTH, drop the function, recreate the function, and then grant the privileges to the function. 116 Give each named parameter marker in a compound SQL (compiled) statement that is dynamically prepared or executed a unique name. 119 Assign the ARRAY field to an ARRAY variable. 120 No response required. Inserting into this type of table is not currently supported. 121 Do not include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 122 Include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 123 To disable automatic reorg recompress, contact IBM Support. 124 Issue the statement or operation at a non-catalog member. 125 Follow the documented process for applying catalog format changes to this database. 126 Do not include the system hidden columns in the index or constraint. 127 Ensure that the SET TENANT statement is not executed inside a routine. 128 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 129 Set registry variable DB2_BLOCK_REORG_PENDING to OFF and issue the ALTER TABLE statement. The table will be in reorg pending until REORG TABLE with the CLASSIC option is performed against the table. 130 If possible, define the BEFORE trigger using a compound SQL (inlined) statement. 131 Refer to the Db2 documentation for any limitation on the requested function to determine which one is relevant. 132 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 133 Ensure that the source database level and target database level are the same. 134 If the DATA CAPTURE CHANGES clause is not needed, remove it from the SQL statement. Otherwise, set registry variable DB2_CDE_DCC to a boolean true value (TRUE, T, YES, Y, ON, or 1). After changing the registry variable, deactivate and reactivate the database. 135 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify either ALLOW READ ACCESS or ALLOW NO ACCESS. 136 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify ALLOW NO ACCESS. sqlcode : -270 sqlstate : 42997"}]}

Nor can a collection method be directly invoked using the field. 120 An attempt was made to insert data into an unsupported type of table. 121 The period-definition of a row-organized table must not include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause. 122 The period-definition of a column-organized table must include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause. 123 The command cannot be run unless automatic reorg recompress is disabled. 124 Issuing DML or operations at the dedicated catalog member is not supported. 125 The prerequisite catalog format changes are not yet applied to this database. 126 The following system hidden columns SYSROWID, CREATEXID, and DELETEXID of row modification tracking enabled tables cannot be specified as part of an index key. 127 The SET TENANT statement is not supported inside a routine. 128 This action is not supported within a user-defined tenant. 129 Registry variable DB2_BLOCK_REORG_PENDING is set to ON, preventing any ALTER TABLE statements that would result in the table being placed in reorg pending state. 130 SKIP LOCKED DATA clause is not supported for tables using a Compound SQL (compiled) statement in the body of a BEFORE trigger. 131 Requested function is not supported in this configuration or environment. 132 This action is only supported in the default SYSTEM tenant. 133 A table space rollforward action is not supported when it involves a database-level update operation. 134 The DATA CAPTURE CHANGES clause is specified for a column-organized table, but registry variable DB2_CDE_DCC is not set. 135 When using the ALLOW WRITE ACCESS mode for Db2 pureScale configurations, online index reorganization in rebuild mode is not supported. This restriction applies to non-recoverable databases only. 136 When using the ALLOW WRITE ACCESS or ALLOW READ ACCESS mode for Db2 pureScale configurations, online index reorganization in rebuild mode is not supported with the number of indexes currently defined on the table or table partition (if it is a range-partitioned table)."}]}

Modify the heap-name heap value to increase the heap or stack size. If heap-name is set to AUTOMATIC, increase the appl_memory database configuration setting, the database_memory database configuration settings, or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. Otherwise, modify the heap-name heap value to increase the heap size. The package cache and catalog cache have soft limits, and for these, you will need to increase the database_memory database configuration setting or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. If heap-name is set to BigSQL IO, the Big SQL Java reader and writer memory is exceeded (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError or java.lang.StackOverflowError). In this case, the fenced mode process (FMP) managing the JVM is marked as unstable, and a new FMP is created to handle any new requests to the Big SQL Java reader and writer JVM. If this error is being returned frequently, the system might not be configured properly to handle resource requirements. The default maximum memory (-Xmx) for the Java reader and writer FMP is computed as a percentage of instance_memory, so this might need to be increased. Setting the database_memory database configuration parameter to AUTOMATIC directs the database manager to manage database memory automatically. To increase the application shared heap size, increase either the appl_memory database configuration setting, or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. When updating a configuration parameter, it is good practice to change the value by no more than 10% at a time until the error condition is resolved. For example, suppose that heap-name is util_heap_sz and the database name is TORDB1. To update this database configuration parameter to 10000, run the following command: db2 update db cfg for tordb1 using util_heap_sz 10000 Copy to clipboard To view a list of the database configuration parameters, use the GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION command. To update the value of a database manager configuration parameter, say mon_heap_sz to 100, run the following command: db2 update dbm cfg using mon_heap_sz 100 Copy to clipboard To view a list of the database manager configuration parameters, use the GET DATABASE MANAGER CONFIGURATION command. If all associated configuration parameters are set to either AUTOMATIC or COMPUTED, then the memory demands of the instance exceed the amount of memory that is configured on the machine. Possible solutions include reducing the database workload, enabling the connection concentrator feature, or adding more memory to the machine. sqlcode : -973 sqlstate : 57011"}]}

For reason code 35, you attempted to perform a heuristic operation against a database that only participates as a read-only resource manager in a global transaction. Examples are any DRDA databases such as DB2 on MVS. These type of non-XA databases would not have any XA indoubt transactions. For reason codes 36, 37, and 38, you attempted to perform an invalid heuristic operation on an indoubt transaction. Either you specified the wrong XID, or a heuristic or resync operation had taken place since you recorded this XID. Perform a Heuristic Query request to get the current list of indoubt transactions to verify if you still need to perform your heuristic operation.

In this case, one of the data sources has failed during transaction processing. The reason code returned in this case is the reason for the failure at the data source, not the federated database. The possible reason codes (corresponding X/Open XA reason codes are shown in parenthesis) are: 01 - (XAER_ASYNC) asynchronous operation already outstanding. 02 - (XAER_RMERR) a resource manager error occurred in the transaction branch. 03 - (XAER_NOTA) the XID is not valid. 04 - (XAER_INVAL) invalid arguments were given. Possible subcodes are: 01 - xa_info pointer is invalid, eg. the XAOpen string is null. 02 - database name exceeds maximum length. 03 - username exceeds maximum length. 04 - password exceeds maximum length. 05 - username specified but not a password. 06 - password specified but not a username. 07 - too many parameters in the xa_info string. 08 - multiple xa_opens generate different RM ids for the same database name. 09 - database name not specified. 10 - invalid exe_type. 11 - the Sybase LRM name is not present in the xa_config file or the xa_config file does not exist. 05 - (XAER_PROTO) routine invoked in improper context. 06 - (XAER_RMFAIL) resource manager unavailable. 07 - (XAER_DUPID) the XID already exits. 08 - (XAER_OUTSIDE) RM doing work outside global transaction. 09 - registration (ax_reg) with the transaction manager failed. Possible subcodes are: 01 - Joining XID not found 02 - dynamic library specified in the tp_mon_name configuration parameter could not be loaded. 10 - attempted to start a different transaction while suspended. 12 - unregistering (ax_unreg) with the transaction manager failed. 13 - ax interface failure: ax_reg() and ax_unreg() not found. 14 - The enlistment with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator has failed. MSDTC service may be down. You must terminate the current transaction. 15 - The transaction does not exist. 16 - A failure occurred with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). Possible subcodes are: 01 - The database manager is unable to communicate with the MSDTC. 02 - The MSDTC is unable to register the connection. The subcode represents the Microsoft error code. 03 - MSDTC is unable to enlist the connection in the Distributed Transaction. The subcode represents the Microsoft error code. 04 - The connection cannot be enlisted as there is an active transaction. 05 - No transaction exists. The connection has not been enlisted. 35 - Heuristic operations are invalid for non-XA database. 36 - The XID is not known by the database manager. 37 - The transaction has already been heuristically committed. 38 - The transaction has already been heuristically rolled back. 39 - The transaction is not an indoubt transaction. 40 - Only rollbacks are allowed for this transaction. 41 - Transaction is not heuristically committed on some MPP subordinator nodes because of node failure. 42 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to outbound connections that were established using TCPIP. 43 - A connection could not be established because the server does not support native XA. 69 - Database log ID mismatch during DUOW resynchronization. 85 - As a result of heuristic processing, the transaction has partially committed and rolled back. 210 - Only heuristic commits are allowed for this transaction. Some nodes are already in commit state. 221 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database. 222 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate the same XA transaction have the same CCSID. 223 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to local clients or remote clients that use TCPIP to establish the inbound connection. 224 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to clients that are at least version 7.1. 225 - Operation Invalid in an XA Loosely Coupled Transaction. Possible subcodes are: 01 - DDL statements are not allowed. 02 - updates and deletes specifying WHERE CURRENT OF clause are not allowed. 03 - buffered insert operations are not allowed. 04 - only rollbacks are allowed for this transaction. 05 - implicit rebind operations are not allowed. 226 - The transaction has already been rolled back. 227 - Heuristic request should be run on the coordinator node. 228 - There are open cursors. 229 - The previous transaction is not yet complete. 230 - The transaction has already been committed."}]}
