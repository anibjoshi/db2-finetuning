In this context, \"memory limits\" include the following examples: Statement heap (STMTHEAP) Application heap (APPLHEAPSZ) Application memory (APPL_MEMORY) Instance memory (INSTANCE_MEMORY) Other process or system memory limits For example, this message can be returned for the following reasons: The statement heap isn't large enough to compile the statement.  (The statement heap is used by the SQL or XQuery compiler as a work space when compiling SQL or XQuery statements.) There is not enough application memory to service application requests. If the statement is one that creates or modifies a packed description, the new packed description might be too large for the corresponding column in the system catalogs.

Code page conversion: If character data is being converted between two different code pages, this message can be returned when the result of a data conversion exceeds a limit (even when the original data did not exceed any limits.) Respond to this error by taking one or more of the following actions: Increase the size of the statement heap using the stmtheap database configuration parameter, or enable the statement heap to grow automatically by setting the stmtheap parameter to AUTOMATIC. Enable the amount of memory that is allocated for application requests to grow automatically by setting the appl_memory database configuration parameter to AUTOMATIC. Break the statement up into shorter or less complex SQL statements. Reduce the complexity of the statement by making one or more of the following types of changes: Reduce the number of constraints, such as table check constraints or foreign key constraints, involved in the statement. Reduce the number of triggers involved in the statement. Reduce the number of row access controls or column access controls involved in the statement.

The application server name specified in the SQL CONNECT statement is greater than 18 bytes. The string constant beginning with string has a length greater than 32672 bytes. Character strings with lengths greater than 32672 bytes or graphic strings with lengths greater than 16336 characters can be specified only through assignment from host variables. Note that other servers in the DB2 family of products may specify a different size limit for character strings. Consult the documentation for the appropriate database product for details. In an XQuery expression, a string literal beginning with string has a length greater than 32672 bytes. The limit is determined on the string literal encoded in UTF-8. A string with length greater than 32672 bytes can only be specified in an XQuery expression using XML values from the database through the XQuery functions that access data or through an XQuery variable assigned a value using SQL/XML functions like XMLQUERY, XMLEXISTS, or XMLTABLE. Federated system users: the data source-specific limits must not be exceeded in a pass-through session. For example, a character literal larger than 254 bytes included in a statement sent to DB2 for OS/390 in a pass-through session would cause this error. The job ID string on the INGEST command is greater than 128 bytes. The date, time, or timestamp format string in a field definition on the INGEST command is greater than its maximum length.  Date format strings have a maximum length of 10 bytes.  Time format strings have a maximum length of 8 bytes.  Timestamp format strings have a maximum length of 32 bytes. It may be that data conversion is occurring and the resultant string is too long.  For connections between applications and databases running under different codepages, string constants are converted from the application codepage to the database codepage.  In certain situations, graphic string constants may be further converted from the database codepage to a UCS-2 (UNICODE) encoding, for example when the database has been created with an EUC codepage. This means that it is possible to have a resultant string which is longer than the input string. The statement cannot be processed.

application. 59 A function or method that contains SQL statements cannot be used in a partitioned database environment. 60 The ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET INLINE LENGTH statement is not allowed because there is an object of type VIEW, either typed or untyped, that depends on the typed table. 61 A text search function cannot be used in the expression for check constraints or generated columns. 62 The WITH CHECK OPTION clause cannot be used with views that reference text search functions directly or depend on other views referencing text search functions. 63 A column with a LOB type, distinct type on a LOB type, A column with a LONG VARCHAR, LONG VARGRAPHIC, DATALINK, LOB, XML type, distinct type on any of these types, or structured type cannot be specified in the select-list of an insensitive scrollable cursor. 64 Federated processing is not supported on this platform. 65 Altering the nickname local type from the current type to the specified type is not allowed. 66 The built-in transform group SYSSTRUCT is not supported. 67 Nicknames or views on nicknames cannot be specified as target in a MERGE or UPDATE statement. 68 In a partitioned database, the maximum number of distinct  NEXT VALUE expressions supported in an SQL statement is 55. 69 Delete from view would cause a descendent table to be delete-connected via multiple paths to two or more tables that appear in the view definition.  Either a check constraint or trigger defined on the descendent table needs to be fired according to the final result which is not guaranteed. 70 A column cannot be dropped, or have its length, data type, security, or nullability altered on a table which is a base table of a view enabled for query optimization. 71 CALL statement cannot be used in a trigger, a SQL function, a SQL method or a dynamic compound statement in a partitioned database environment. 72 A nullable column cannot be changed to become an identity column. 73 Backup images in a partitioned database environment are not allowed to include logs. 74 Updating a status field in the recovery history file by time stamp is not allowed. 75 Automatic statistics profiling is not supported on a multiple database partition system, on a system where SMP is enabled, or on a federated system. 83 For versions of DB2 database prior to V9.7, the statement cannot be processed because DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and COMPRESS YES are not compatible. 87 The following types of tables cannot be defined as partitioned tables:  typed tables, staging tables, user temporary tables, and range clustered tables. 89 REORG INDEX is only supported for nonpartitioned indexes on partitioned tables or for the CLEANUP ONLY ALL option. 90 For versions of DB2 database prior to Version 9.7, the PARTITIONED clause cannot be specified on the CREATE INDEX statement because partitioned indexes are not supported. 91 For versions of DB2 database prior to V9.7, the statement cannot be processed because DATA CAPTURE CHANGES is not supported for a table that has a compression dictionary. 92 Detaching from a table that is the parent of an enforced referential integrity constraint is not allowed. 93 Detaching a partition is not allowed for partitions that contain data that was appended using LOAD INSERT, and that have dependent materialized query tables or dependent staging tables that have not been incrementally refreshed with respect to the appended data. 95 A table with an attached partition whose integrity has not been verified yet cannot be altered to be a materialized query table. 97 Altering this data type is not supported for an element of the multinode distribution key, data distribution key, or MDC organizing dimension. 98 Altering the type of an identity column is not supported. 99 An alter table set data type changed the external UDF used by a check constraint. 102 A security policy cannot be added to a typed table. 103 On database servers Version 9.5 and earlier, online index reorganization in ALLOW WRITE mode is not supported for tables with XML columns. 104 In place table REORG is not allowed if an index on an XML column is defined on the table. 105 The REORG INDEX command is supported only for block indexes in CLEANUP or RECLAIM EXTENTS mode. 106 Attaching a partition to a materialized query table is not supported. 109 A text search function cannot be applied to the text index of a partitioned table if the text search function does not directly reference the partitioned  table or is a member of a sub-select that contains an OUTER JOIN clause. 110 For SECLABEL, SECLABEL_BY_NAME, and SECLABEL_TO_CHAR, the security policy name parameter must be a string constant. 111 An audit policy cannot be associated with a typed table. 112 The health monitor does not support configuration of actions and notifications on non-root installations. 113 Use of a Compound SQL (compiled) statement in the body of a trigger or SQL table function is not supported in partitioned database environments. 114 Partitioned spatial indexes are not supported. 115 The function cannot be revalidated. 116 The same name was used for more than one named parameter marker in a compound SQL (compiled) statement that is dynamically prepared or executed. 119 If a field of a ROW variable has an ARRAY type, then array element values cannot be directly retrieved by specifying the corresponding index value for the element on the ROW variable field reference. Nor can a collection method be directly invoked using the field. 120 An attempt was made to insert data into an unsupported type of table. 121 The period-definition of a row-organized table must not include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause. 122 The period-definition of a column-organized table must include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause. 123 The command cannot be run unless automatic reorg recompress is disabled. 124 Issuing DML or operations at the dedicated catalog member is not supported. 125 The prerequisite catalog format changes are not yet applied to this database. 126 The following system hidden columns SYSROWID, CREATEXID, and DELETEXID of row modification tracking enabled tables cannot be specified as part of an index key. 127 The SET TENANT statement is not supported inside a routine. 128 This action is not supported within a user-defined tenant. 129 Registry variable DB2_BLOCK_REORG_PENDING is set to ON, preventing any ALTER TABLE statements that would result in the table being placed in reorg pending state. 130 SKIP LOCKED DATA clause is not supported for tables using a Compound SQL (compiled) statement in the body of a BEFORE trigger. 131 Requested function is not supported in this configuration or environment. 132 This action is only supported in the default SYSTEM tenant. 133 A table space rollforward action is not supported when it involves a database-level update operation. 134 The DATA CAPTURE CHANGES clause is specified for a column-organized table,\n\tbut registry variable DB2_CDE_DCC is not set. 135 When using the ALLOW WRITE ACCESS mode for Db2 pureScale configurations, online\n\tindex reorganization in rebuild mode is not supported. This restriction applies to\n\tnon-recoverable databases only. 136 When using the ALLOW WRITE ACCESS or ALLOW READ ACCESS mode for Db2 pureScale\n\tconfigurations, online index reorganization in rebuild mode is not supported with\n\tthe number of indexes currently defined on the table or table partition (if it is\n\ta range-partitioned table). The action corresponding to the reason code is as follows: 1 Correct the CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE or CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement. 2 Do not attempt to update the distribution key columns for a multipartition table, or consider deleting and then inserting the row with the new values in the distribution columns. 3 Make the distribution key column not nullable, specify a different ON DELETE action, or change the distribution key of the table so that the foreign key does not include any columns of the distribution key. 4 Either specify DATA CAPTURE NONE or ensure that the table is placed in a table space in a single-partition database partition group that specifies the catalog partition. 5 Do not use the WITH CHECK OPTION clause, or remove the function or view from the view definition. 6 Transforms are automatic for user-defined distinct types. Use the CREATE TRANSFORM statement for user-defined structured types only. 7 Use a table space with a 4 KB page size for any table that includes long fields. If you are using DMS table spaces, you can place long fields in a table space with a 4 KB page size with other table or index data in table spaces with a different page size. When defining a LARGE TABLESPACE, use PAGESIZE 4K. 8 For servers prior to DB2 UDB Version 7.1, ensure that no column data types are structured types in the CREATE TABLE statement or ALTER TYPE ADD COLUMN statement.  Ensure that no attribute data types are structured types in the CREATE TYPE statement or ALTER TYPE ADD ATTRIBUTE statement. 9 Do not define triggers on typed tables. 10 Either reduce the row size or number of columns in the table or specify two table spaces such that the long data is in a table space with a 4 KB page size and the base data is in a table space with an 8 KB page size. 11 When creating a typed table or typed view, specify a structured type that has at least one attribute defined. 12 For the type of a source key parameter, use only a user-defined structured type or a distinct type that is not sourced on a LOB, XML, LONG VARCHAR, or LONG VARGRAPHIC type. 13 In a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement for a typed table, do not specify check constraints.  In a CREATE VIEW statement for a typed view, do not specify the WITH CHECK OPTION clause. 14 Do not specify referential constraints involving typed tables in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement. 15 Do not specify a DEFAULT clause for a column with a reference data type in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement. 16 For servers prior to DB2 UDB Version 7.1, do not specify a structured type parameter or returns type when creating a user-defined function. Otherwise, do not specify a scoped reference type as a parameter or returns type. Do not specify a structured type as a return column of a table or row function. 17 Do not specify a typed table in the SET INTEGRITY statement. 18 Do not include specific column names when granting REFERENCES or UPDATE privileges on a typed table, typed view, or nickname. 19 Include a specific value when specifying the DEFAULT clause on a column of a typed table. 20 Drop the materialized query table, and re-create it with the desired attributes. 21 To drop or alter a column in a table that is a base table for a materialized query table,  perform the following steps: Drop the dependent materialized query table. Drop the column of the base table, or alter the length, data type, nullability, or hidden attribute of this column. Re-create the materialized query table. 22 Issue the CREATE SUMMARY TABLE statement outside of the CREATE SCHEMA statement. 23 Either remove the REPLICATED specification or ensure that REFRESH DEFERRED is specified for the materialized query  table definition. 24 Remove the reference to the materialized query table in the triggered-action in the BEFORE trigger. 25 Issue separate SET INTEGRITY IMMEDIATE CHECKED statements for each materialized query table. 26 Drop all replicated materialized query tables in the database partition group, and then issue the REDISTRIBUTE DATABASE PARTITION GROUP command again. Re-create the replicated materialized query tables. 27 Ensure that a subset of the columns defined for the materialized query table also is the set of columns that make up a unique index on the base table. 28 You can change a typed table or materialized query table name only by dropping the table and creating it again with the new name.  Dropping the table might have implications on other objects that depend on the table, and the privileges on the table are lost. 29 Remove the FOR EXCEPTION clause from the SET INTEGRITY statement. 30 Issue the CREATE statement for the typed view or typed table outside of the CREATE SCHEMA statement. 31 Reduce the number of columns in the distribution key. 32 Either specify NO LINK CONTROL for the DATALINK column or place the table in a table space on a single-partitioned database partition group that specifies the catalog partition. If you are redistributing data to a multiple-partition database partition group, you must drop the table to continue with the redistribute. 33 Use one of the following approaches: Do not define a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL) on an underlying table of a materialized query table defined with REFRESH IMMEDIATE as the child. Do not define a REFRESH IMMEDIATE materialized query table whose underlying table is the child of a referential constraint with cascading effect (that is, with option ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL). 34 Remove the use of any unsupported object relational features. 35 Do not create or remove the GENERATED [ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT] AS IDENTITY ... attribute. 36 Drop the new node or nodes to go back to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, drop the sequences or tables with identity columns before adding new nodes. 38 An index using an index extension cannot be created on a table in a multiple partition database partition group. A database partition group cannot become a multiple partition database partition group while an index using an index extension exists on a table in the database partition group. Either drop any such indexes and add the partition to the database partition group, in which case the indexes cannot be re-created, or leave the database partition group unchanged. 39 Remove the reference to a nickname or OLE DB table function, or remove the reference to the object that indirectly references one of these. 40 Remove the invocation of the IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL function from the trigger definition or the SQL function definition. 41 Split the assignment into two separate statements. One statement must assign values only to SQL variables, and the other statement must assign values only to transition variables. 42 Drop the new node or nodes to return to a single node configuration. If you require more nodes, you must drop the triggers, functions, or methods containing control statements. 43 Reissue the RUNSTATS command and turn off the unsupported option. 44 You cannot use these EXPLAIN modes in SMP, MPP, and Data Joiner environments. If possible, run the query in serial mode. Otherwise, set the EXPLAIN mode to YES or EXPLAIN to provide the same information except for the actual cardinalities. 45 Do not specify the APPEND clause in an ALTER TABLE statement for multi-dimensionally clustered (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 46 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 47 Do not specify the EXTENSION clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 48 Drop the multidimensional clustering (MDC) table and re-create it with the modified dimension specification. 49 Do not specify the CLUSTER clause in a CREATE INDEX statement for multidimensional clustering (MDC) or insert time clustering (ITC) tables. 50 Do not specify the ORGANIZE BY clause in a CREATE TABLE statement for declared global temporary tables. 51 Issue the CREATE INDEX statement from the catalog database partition. 52 Do not modify the expression or add it to an existing column. To change the composition of the PARTITIONING KEY clause, the ORGANIZE BY clause, the PARTITION BY clause, the DISTRIBUTE BY clause, or the generating expression of any of its members that are generated columns, drop and re-create the table and then repopulate it. 53 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not include a column with these types. 54 Reissue the REORG command without specifying the INPLACE option. 55 Turn off concentrator or federated database system support. Turn off the concentrator by setting the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_CONNECTIONS to be less than or equal to the value of the database manager configuration parameter MAX_COORDAGENTS. Turn off federated database system support by setting the FEDERATED parameter in the database manager configuration to NO. 56 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 57 Reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW NONE or ALLOW READ. 58 For a Version 8 database: Input the XML data to one of the functions that accept XML input (ultimately XMLSERIALIZE) and store the output of the function in the database or return it to the application. 59 In a partitioned database environment, only use functions and methods defined with the NO SQL option. 60 Drop the views that depend on the typed table. Reissue the ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET INLINE LENGTH statement for the typed table, and re-create the views that you dropped. 61 Do not use the text search function in the expression for check constraints or generated columns. Use the LIKE function instead of CONTAINS, if possible. 62 Do not specify the WITH CHECK OPTION clause for this view. 63 Modify the select-list of the scrollable cursor to not        include a column with these types. 64 Do not attempt federated processing on this platform. 65 Do not attempt to alter the nickname local type from the current type to the specified type. 66 Do not specify SYSSTRUCT as a transform group. 67 Do not specify a nickname or a view on nicknames as a target in a MERGE or UPDATE statement. 68 Reduce the number of distinct NEXT VALUE expressions in  the statement, or change to a non-partitioned database. 69 Do not use DELETE FROM view-name. 70 Disable the views enabled for query optimization, drop or alter the column of the base table and then enable the views for query optimization. 71 In a partitioned database environment, do not use the CALL statement in a trigger, an SQL function, an SQL method, or a dynamic compound statement. 72 The column cannot become an identity column while it is nullable. To make this change, the table must be dropped and re-created with a not null column and then repopulated. Adding a new column as the identity column might also be considered. 73 Issue the BACKUP command without specifying the INCLUDE LOGS option. 74 Update the status field in the recovery history file by EID only. 75 Use one of the following approaches: Disable automatic statistics profiling for this database by setting the database configuration parameters AUTO_STATS_PROF and AUTO_PROF_UPD to OFF. Change the system to one that is on a single database partition, that does not have SMP enabled, and that is not federated. 83 If both DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and COMPRESS YES are being specified, you must only specify one of them. If one of DATA CAPTURE CHANGES or COMPRESS YES is being specified, you must not specify it as the other is already in effect on the table. 87 Create the table as a non-partitioned table. 89 Use the REORG INDEXES ALL command to reorganize all indexes on the table or data partition. 90 Create a nonpartitioned index by using the default or by explicitly specifying  NOT PARTITIONED on CREATE INDEX. 91 Do not specify DATA CAPTURE CHANGES for this table. 92 Drop the referential constraint by using the following statement: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard DROP CONSTRAINT ... Copy to clipboard Alternatively, alter the child table in the foreign key relationship so that the foreign key constraint is not enforced: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... NOT ENFORCED Copy to clipboard Note: The failing detach statement was executed from the parent table  in the foreign key constraint, while the constraint enforcement is executed  on the child table.  These two tables are distinct unless the foreign key  constraint is self-referential. Next, resubmit the ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION statement. You can now alter the child table to enforce the foreign key constraint: ALTER TABLE 'child-table' Copy to clipboard ALTER FOREIGN KEY ... ENFORCED Copy to clipboard This will recheck the tables to ensure that the foreign key relationship is still being enforced. 93 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option to maintain the dependent materialized query tables or dependent staging tables with respect to the data that was appended using LOAD INSERT. 95 Issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED or IMMEDIATE UNCHECKED option on the table to verify the integrity of the attached partition. 97 Do not alter the column data type. 98 Drop the identity attribute, alter the type, and then re-enable the identity attribute. 99 Drop the check constraint, and then re-issue the ALTER statement. 102 Do not add a security policy to a typed table. 103 On database servers Version 9.5 and earlier, reissue the REORG INDEXES command, specifying ALLOW READ ACCESS or ALLOW NO ACCESS. 104 Remove the INPLACE option and reissue the REORG TABLE command. 105 Reissue the REORG INDEX command specifying CLEANUP, or RECLAIM EXTENT, or issue REORG INDEXES ALL to reorganize all indexes (including the block indexes) for the table. 106 Issue the ALTER TABLE statement to drop the materialized query attribute from the table before attempting to attach a partition to the table. 109 Modify the query to place the text search function in a sub-select  that directly references the partitioned table that contains the  text index and that does not contain an OUTER JOIN clause. 110 Provide a string constant for the security policy name parameter. 111 Do not associate an audit policy with a typed table. 112 Do not try to configure actions or notifications for the health monitor on non-root installations. 113 If possible, define the trigger or function using a compound SQL (inlined) statement, or remove the trigger or function definition. 114 Create the spatial index as a nonpartitioned index by using the NOT PARTITIONED clause on the CREATE INDEX statement. 115 Record the privileges granted to the function in SYSCAT.ROUTINEAUTH, drop the function, recreate the function, and then grant the privileges to the function. 116 Give each named parameter marker in a compound SQL (compiled) statement that is dynamically prepared or executed a unique name. 119 Assign the ARRAY field to an ARRAY variable. 120 No response required.  Inserting into this type of table is not currently supported. 121 Do not include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 122 Include the MAINTAINED BY USER clause on this table. 123 To disable automatic reorg recompress, contact IBM Support. 124 Issue the statement or operation at a non-catalog member. 125 Follow the documented process for applying catalog format changes to this database. 126 Do not include the system hidden columns in the index or constraint. 127 Ensure that the SET TENANT statement is not executed inside a routine. 128 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 129 Set registry variable DB2_BLOCK_REORG_PENDING to OFF and issue the ALTER TABLE statement. The table will be in reorg pending until REORG TABLE with the CLASSIC option is performed against the table. 130 If possible, define the BEFORE trigger using a compound SQL (inlined) statement. 131 Refer to the Db2 documentation for any limitation on the requested function to determine which one is relevant. 132 Associate the current connection with the default SYSTEM tenant and try this action again. 133 Ensure that the source database level and target database level are the same. 134 If the DATA CAPTURE CHANGES clause is not needed, remove it from the SQL\n\tstatement. Otherwise, set registry variable DB2_CDE_DCC to a boolean true\n\tvalue (TRUE, T, YES, Y, ON, or 1). After changing the registry variable,\n\tdeactivate and reactivate the database. 135 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify either ALLOW READ ACCESS\n\tor ALLOW NO ACCESS. 136 Reissue the index reorganization command and specify ALLOW NO ACCESS. sqlcode :  -270 sqlstate :  42997"}]}

The possible causes of this error include the following. A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement included a container that is already in use by another table space. A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement included a container from a table space that has been dropped but the drop statement has not been committed. An ALTER DATABASE PARTITION statement used to add a database partition used the containers of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use. A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement is attempting to use the same container on more than one logical database partition on a single physical database partition. The same containers cannot be used for more than one database partition on the same physical database partition. An ADD DATABASE PARTITION command or API used the containers from the system temporary table spaces of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use. A CREATE TABLESPACE statement, ALTER TABLESPACE statement, or CREATE DATABASE command  included a DMS container from another database that no longer exists but  was not dropped properly.  The container is not actually in    use but it is tagged as being in use.  Therefore, the DB2 data server will not allow it to be used until it is untagged.  However, it is  very important to verify that the container is not in use by   the same database or another database when untagging it.  If   the container is in use when you untag it, the database (or databases) involved will be corrupted. A REORG attempted to automatically select a DMS temporary table space  for use, and although one with the correct page size exists, it is  currently in use by another REORG command. The ADD DBPARTITIONNUM option of the REDISTRIBUTE command, which was used to add a  database partition, creates table space container names on the newly added database partition  based on the table space container names of the table spaces on the lowest numbered database  partition. If these container names specify absolute paths, and if the new database partition  is on the same physical device as a database partition using the same container names, then  the containers for the new partition would already be in use. A RESTORE DATABASE command has found containers from a database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly. A temporary staging database was created for a transport operation, and then an attempt was made to create a table space on the target database while the temporary staging database still exists. Ensure the containers are unique. For the CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement, specify a different container for the table space. For the CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement including a container from a dropped table space, try again after the drop statement is committed or specify a different container. For the ALTER DATABASE PARTITION statement, reissue the statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers for the new database partition. For CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statements where the environment includes more than one logical database partition on a physical database partition, ensure that the same containers are not specified for such logical database partition. For an ADD DATABASE PARTITION command or API, reissue the statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers at the new database partition for the system temporary table spaces. If you are trying to use a DMS container that belonged to a    database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly,   then the db2untag utility can be used to remove the DB2      container tag from it.  When this tag is removed DB2     considers the container to be free and the container can be    used in a CREATE TABLESPACE statement,  ALTER TABLESPACE statement, or CREATE DATABASE command. NOTE: Use extreme caution with db2untag. If you issue a db2untag command against a container that is still in use by a database, then both the database that originally used the container and the database that is now using the container will be corrupted. For REORG, resubmit the command once the initial REORG that is using  the required table space completes, or provide another temporary  table space of the correct page size for use. For the REDISTRIBUTE command, instead of using the ADD DBPARTITIONNUM option, before issuing the  REDISTRIBUTE command issue the ALTER DATABASE PARTITION GROUP statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES  clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers for the new database  partition. For the RESTORE DATABASE command (where a container belongs to a database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly), remove the container. NOTE: Ensure that the container is not in use by another database prior to removing it. If a temporary staging database was created for a transport operation, remove the temporary staging database after the staging database is no longer needed, and then attempt operations on the target that were blocked as a result of the existence of the staging database. sqlcode :  -294 sqlstate :  42730"}]}

The file implementing the routine is identified by library-or-path , and the function by function-code-id . The library name, path name, or the function name might be truncated due to a limit on the maximum available token length. The following query can be used to get the complete library path and function names from the system catalog views: SELECT implementation\n\t\t FROM syscat.routines\n\t\t WHERE specificname = 'specific-name' Copy to clipboard 1 Path name library-or-path is longer than the maximum (255 bytes). 2 The database manager instance path name could not be retrieved from DB2. 3 The path library-or-path could not be found. 4 The file in library-or-path could not be found, because of one of the following reasons: The routine library associated with the routine is not available in the location specified by the EXTERNAL clause in the routine CREATE statement definition. The routine library is dependent on a shared library that cannot be located (within the concatenation of directories specified in the LIBPATH environment variable in UNIX-based systems, or the PATH environment variable in Windows systems). There can be multiple levels of this indirection involved, leading to this reason code. For example, routine body X can be found, and it needs shared library Y which can also be found. But Y needs another shared library Z that cannot be located. This is a partitioned database and the library is not located in one of the partitions on which the user-defined function was run. 5 There is insufficient memory to load the library containing the function or one or more symbols could not be resolved. This reason code indicates one of the following situations: One or more symbols might not have been resolved. The routine library might be dependent on a shared library that cannot be located (using the concatenation of directories specified in the LIBPATH environment variable in UNIX-based systems, the PATH environment variable in Windows systems). The routine has a 64-bit library which is not supported within a 32-bit instance, or, the routine has a 32-bit library or DLL within a 64-bit instance that is incompatible with the routine definition. There was insufficient memory to load the library containing the function. 6 The function function-code-id could not be found in the library that was named. 7 The symbol given as the function name ( function-code-id ) is not the name of a valid function in the named library. 8 The \"load\" system function has failed, for reasons other than those given in this message. The object file might not have been linked properly or not have been linked at all. 9 There was insufficient memory to resolve the function name function-code-id in the library identified in library-or-path . 10 The \"loadquery\" system call has failed. This can only happen on UNIX operating systems, and is a symptom that the database manager has not been installed correctly. 11 The agent process is searching for a particular database manager function that should be in the libdb2.a library, and it cannot find it. This can only happen on UNIX operating systems, and is a symptom that the database manager is not correctly installed. 15 System or network access has been denied. This can happen in Windows environments if the EXTERNAL NAME specification in the routine definition statement does not specify a full path, or the function does not exist in the directory called db2_installation_path\\function, necessitating a search using the PATH environment variable. For example, if the PATH contains a LAN drive prior to the directory containing your function and the instance is running under the SYSTEM account, this reason code  can result. 16 Multiple Java methods that could match the function function-code-id were found. Other: An unidentified system failure has occurred. Federated system users: if this user defined function is a function template (and thus no code is required to reside on the federated server), consider modifying the SQL statement or statistics to enable this function to be evaluated on the remote data source. Given for each reason code: 1 Either the routine definition needs to be changed to specify a shorter path, or the database manager instance path name is too long. Analyze the routine definition within the DB2 catalog views to determine which action to take. It may be necessary to move the function body to a directory with a shorter path name. 2, 10, and 11 See your system administrator, and provide them with the full text of the appropriate reason code. 3, 6, and 7 See the routine creator or your database administrator.  Provide them with the full text of the appropriate reason code. The routine definition or the location of the routine library will need to be corrected. 4 Possible solutions are grouped by the causes provided in the message explanation: Make the routine library associated with the routine available: Correct the routine definition EXTERNAL clause value or verify that the routine library is in the location specified by the EXTERNAL clause. For built-in routines, if you have recently updated your database to a different fix pack level that requires updating the system catalog, issue the update database to current release command to update the system catalog including the built-in routines and restart the instance. Verify that the routine library can be accessed by the database manager. For fenced routines, verify that the fenced process owner has EXECUTE access permission on the library or DLL. For unfenced routines, verify that the instance owner has read access permissions on the library or DLL. The routine should be relinked or user should verify that dependent libraries are available in the LIBPATH (UNIX) or PATH (Windows). Use the db2set command to update the LIBPATH to include the path where the library or DLL is located. For example, db2set db2libpath=/db2test/db2inst1/sqll In a partitioned database, the library associated with a user-defined function must be accessible as library-or-path on all partitions of the database. Verify that the routine library has been deployed to the function directory on all partitions of the database. 5 Possible solutions are ordered to match the causes provided in the message explanation: There can be multiple levels of this indirection involved, leading to this reason code. For example, routine body X can be found, and it requires shared library Y which is also found, however Y needs another shared library Z that cannot be located. The routine library should be relinked or the user should verify that all dependent libraries are available in the LIBPATH (UNIX) or PATH (Windows). Use the db2set command to update the LIBPATH to include the path where the library is located. For example:   db2set db2libpath=/db2test/db2inst1/sqll Use a supported library. If a lack of memory is determined then the system configuration may need to be changed to make more memory available to DB2. 8 Ensure that the module is correctly linked. 9 Contact the routine creator or your database administrator to make sure the library containing the function was correctly linked. The system configuration may need to be changed to make more memory available to database server. 15 Verify that the EXTERNAL NAME clause in the routine definition statement contains the full path, or the function exists in the directory called db2_installation_path\\function. If any of these situations is true and the error occurs due to an instance running under an account which cannot access a LAN drive prior to the directory containing your function in the PATH environment variable, you need to reconfigure the DB2 service to run under a user account that has access to all the network paths that are in the PATH environment variable. When assigning a user account to the DB2 service, make sure that the account is granted all the required advanced user rights. 16 Verify that the library-or-path Class referenced in the EXTERNAL NAME clause in the routine definition statement contains a function function-code-id which can be resolved without ambiguity based on the SQL data-types in the routine definition statement. If the routine was defined with PARAMETER STYLE HIVE in the routine definition statement,  check the routine implementation for multiple function-code-id methods.  For example, if there are multiple function-code-id methods, make sure that no two methods contain the same parameter list when those methods can use either the java.lang.String class or the org.apache.hadoop.io.Text substituted for each other. Other: Note the code, and see your system administrator.

In general, this message is returned because the authorization ID does not have the required authority or privilege to perform the operation. In some cases, it is returned for an object that does not allow the operation even when the authorization ID has an administrative authority. This message can be returned for different reasons.  Here are some examples of scenarios in which this message could be returned: Scenario 1 An attempt to create or alter a table that has referential constraints fails because the user does not have REFERENCE privileges. In this scenario, the value of the runtime token operation is \"REFERENCES\" and the value of the runtime token object-name is the object that the constraint references. Scenario 2 Execution of a DB2 utility or CLI application fails because the user ID that created the database no longer exists or no longer has the privileges required to execute the DB2 utility program or CLI package. Scenario 3 Invocation of a routine fails because the user does not have EXECUTE privileges on any candidate routine in the SQL path.  In this scenario, the value of the runtime token object-name is the name of a candidate routine in the SQL path. Scenario 4 Creation of a routine fails because the user ID that was used to bind the routine does not have the privileges necessary to issue all the statements in the routine. Scenario 5 Replacing an existing object by using a CREATE OR REPLACE statement failed because the user is not the owner of the object. Scenario 6 An attempt to complete an online move table operation fails because the user does not have the same authorization ID as the user who initiated the online move table operation. Scenario 7 An attempt is made to perform an unsupported operation on a system-generated statistical view that is associated with an expression-based index.  It is not supported for any user to modify the privileges of or to access this type of statistical view.  However, users with adequate authority and privileges on the underlying table may update the statistics of this type of statistical view, either by issuing the RUNSTATS command or by manually updating the statistics. In Federated environments: This message might be returned when the following actions fail because the user does not have the necessary authority: Altering one of the following user-mapping options: REMOTE_PASSWORD FED_PROXY_USER USE_TRUSTED_CONTEXT Altering a trusted user context Creating or dropping a user mapping that has the FED_PROXY_USER option or the USE_TRUSTED_CONTEXT option Creating or dropping a server that has the FED_PROXY_USER option The required authorization can be at the federated server, at the data source, or at both the federated server and the data source. Some data sources do not provide appropriate values for the runtime tokens authorization-ID , operation , and object-name . In these cases, the message tokens might be in one of the following formats: <data source> AUTHID:UNKNOWN UNKNOWNM <data source> :TABLE/VIEW. If the authorization ID authorization-ID does not have the required authority or privilege, grant the necessary privilege or authority, if appropriate. Here are responses for the scenarios described in the explanation section of this message: Scenario 1 Grant the REFERENCES privilege by using the statement GRANT REFERENCES ON object-name TO authorization-ID . Scenario 2 Rebind the DB2 utility programs or CLI packages to the database by connecting to the database and then issuing one of the following CLP commands from the bnd subdirectory of the instance directory: For the DB2 utilities: DB2 bind @db2ubind.lst blocking all grant public For CLI packages: DB2 bind @db2cli.lst blocking all grant public If the user does not have EXECUTE privileges on the package, grant the EXECUTE privilege on the package, by use executing the GRANT statement. Scenario 3 Grant the EXECUTE privilege on the routine to the authorization ID by executing the GRANT statement. Scenario 4 Grant explicit privileges to the authorization ID on the objects that the statements within the routine are attempting to access. Scenario 5 Respond to scenario 5 in one of the following ways: Issue the statement as the user who is the owner of the object to be replaced. Transfer the ownership of the object by executing the TRANSFER OWNERSHIP statement. Scenario 6 Call the procedure again, using the same authorization ID as the user who initiated the online move table operation. Scenario 7 Specify a different object for the operation. sqlcode :  -551 sqlstate :  5UA0K, 42501"}]}

The cause is based on the following reason codes reason-code : 1 Reason code 1 can be returned in multiple scenarios, including the following examples: The table is in the Set Integrity Pending No Access state, which means the integrity of the table is not enforced and the content of the table might be invalid. An operation on a parent table or an underlying table that is not in the Set Integrity Pending No Access state may also receive this error if a dependent table is in the Set Integrity Pending No Access state. An attempt is made to issue the SET INTEGRITY statement against a user-maintained materialized query table without specifying the IMMEDIATE UNCHECKED clause. 2 The table is in the No Data Movement state. When in this state, operations that cause data movement are disallowed. Data movement operations include REDISTRIBUTE, update of database partitioning key, update of multidimensional clustering key, update of  range clustering key, update of table partitioning key and REORG TABLE. 3 The table is in the Load Pending state. A previous LOAD attempt on this table resulted in failure. No access to the table is allowed until the LOAD operation is restarted or terminated. 4 The table is the Read Access state. This state can occur during on-line LOAD processing (LOAD INSERT with the READ ACCESS option), or after an on-line LOAD operation, but before all constraints have been validated in the newly appended portion of the table using the SET INTEGRITY statement. This state can also occur if the READ ACCESS clause was used when turning off integrity checking with the SET INTEGRITY statement.  No update activity is allowed on this table. 5 The table is in the Load In Progress state. The LOAD utility is currently operating on this table, no access is allowed until the LOAD is finished. 6 Materialized query tables that reference a nickname cannot be refreshed in DB2 Enterprise Server Edition. 7 The table is in the reorg pending state. This can occur after an ALTER TABLE statement containing a REORG-recommended operation. 8 The table is in the alter pending state. This can occur when using the table in the same unit of work as an ALTER TABLE statement containing a REORG-recommended operation. 9 The table is in Redistribute Pending state. The REDISTRIBUTE utility is not completed on this table, no access is allowed until the REDISTRIBUTE is finished. 10 The table is the source table for an ongoing ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE operation. The attempted operation is restricted until the move is completed or canceled. 11 The table, which has a nonpartitioned index, has a new data partition that the operation is attempting to access in the same transaction as the add or attach operation that created the partition, but the transaction does not have the table locked in exclusive mode. 12 The synopsis table being accessed is currently not available for use or is in rebuild pending state. The attempted operation will be restricted until the table is rebuilt successfully. Respond to this error according to the reason code: 1 Bring the table named table-name out of the Set Integrity Pending No Access state according to the type of table: For a user-maintained materialized query table, execute the statement with the IMMEDIATE UNCHECKED option. For materialized query tables that are not user-maintained, execute the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option. 2 Execute REFRESH TABLE statement on the dependent immediate materialized query tables and staging tables of table table-name . The contents of these dependent immediate materialized query tables and staging tables can be incrementally maintained from the appended data of table-name through previous LOAD INSERT operations and from the attached data of table-name through previous ALTER TABLE statements with the ATTACH clause. 3 Move the table out of \"Load Pending\" state. 4 If the Read Access state was due to a LOAD, issue the LOAD QUERY command to check whether the table is in the process of being loaded. If yes, wait until the LOAD utility has completed, or if necessary, restart or terminate previously failed LOAD operation. If LOAD is currently not in progress, issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option, to validate constraints in the newly loaded portion of the table. If the Read Access state was due to turning off integrity checking, issue the SET INTEGRITY statement with the IMMEDIATE CHECKED option. 5 Wait until the current LOAD operation has finished. You can use the LOAD QUERY command to monitor the progress of load. 6 Define a materialized query table using the MAINTAINED BY USER option. Then, use an INSERT statement with a subquery to populate the materialized query table. 7 Reorganize the table using the REORG TABLE command. For a table in the reorg pending state, note that the following clauses are not allowed when reorganizing the table: The INPLACE REORG TABLE clause The ON DATA PARTITION clause for a partitioned table when table has nonpartitioned indexes defined on the table 8 Complete the unit of work, and re-issue the command. 9 If the REDISTRIBUTE utility is working, wait until it finishes working on the current table. You can use the LIST UTILITIES command to monitor the progress of the REDISTRIBUTE utility. If a previous REDISTRIBUTE operation failed and left the table in this state, issue the REDISTRIBUTE utility again with the CONTINUE or ABORT option and let it finish on this table. 10 Complete or cancel the table move operation and reissue the command. You can query the SYSTOOLS.ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE table for information about the status of the move operation. 11 Modify the application so that transactions that include add or attach partition operations are committed prior to the application accessing the new partitions where the target table has a nonpartitioned index. Alternatively, modify the application so that a table that has a nonpartitioned index and that is affected by the online add or attach operation is exclusively locked when a new partition is being accessed in the same transaction as the add or attach operation that created the partition. 12 To enable usage of this table rebuild the table using the REORG SYNOPSIS FOR TABLE base_table REBUILD command. sqlcode :  -668 sqlstate :  57007"}]}

Therefore, the row size is affected by the total number of columns, the total number of LOB columns, and the data type of the columns. The row size limit is the maximum number of bytes of a given table. This limit consists of a defined value in some cases or a variable value that depends on the table space page size.

This message can also be returned when a change to a column-organized base table causes the associated synopsis table to exceed the size limit.  When this happens, the limit token will indicate that it is the synopsis table which has exceeded the limit. To resolve the issue reported by this message, perform the following steps: For row size limits: Calculate the row size of the table that you are trying to create or modify. Determine the limit or restriction exceeded by the row size. For row-organized tables: the row size limit is determined by the table space page size. For column-organized tables: the limit is the column-organized table maximum row size. Perform one of the following actions: Reduce the row size by reducing the lengths of one or more columns, specifying a different data type, or eliminating one or more columns. For row-organized tables only: Specify in the statement a table space with a page size that fits the row size that you calculated. If reducing the row size or finding a table space with a larger page size is not possible, enable the extended row size configuration parameter, extended_row_sz, which allows row length to exceed the maximum record length for the page size of the table space. For column size limits: Determine the maximum column size for the table that you are trying to create or modify, based on the column type and the underlying page size.

Check the message associated with the SQLCODE of the SQL statement that failed.  Follow the action suggested by that message. For an invalid package, the REBIND command can be used to recreate the error or to explicitly validate the package once the cause of the error has been resolved. For a failure that occurred while a database object was being revalidated: Determine the name of the database object that could not be revalidated by locating the revalidation failure message in the administration notification log. To avoid this error in the future, you can do one of the following: If the database object that is causing this error is no longer needed, drop the database object. If the statement or command that caused this database object to be revalidated can be changed, change the statement or command so that the next time that statement is executed or that command is run the database object will not be revalidated. Revalidated the database object now by doing one of the following: Execute an SQL statement that directly references the database object. Call the ADMIN_REVALIDATE_DB_OBJECTS procedure for the database object.

The column can be renamed by taking one of the following actions. Determine the name of the system-period temporal table that uses the history table and issue the RENAME COLUMN  operation with that name as the target of the ALTER TABLE statement. This renames the column in both  the system-period temporal table and the associated history table. Determine the name of the system-period temporal table and issue the DROP VERSIONING operation with that name  as the target of ALTER TABLE statement. This changes the history table and the system-period temporal table into  a regular tables. You can now rename the column of the table in your original ALTER TABLE statement.

Alternatively, a DELETE statement on a parent table caused the update of a foreign key in a dependent table table-name that is constrained by one or more UNIQUE indexes. Unique indexes might support primary keys or unique constraints defined on a table.

If a view is the object of the INSERT or UPDATE statement, it is the table table-name on which the view is defined that is constrained. If the index is on an XML column, the duplicate values for the index key can be generated from within a single XML document.

Examine the definition for the index identified by index-id . For an UPDATE statement, ensure that the specified operation is not itself inconsistent with the uniqueness constraint. If this does not show the error, examine the object table content to determine the cause of the problem. For an INSERT statement, examine the object table content to determine which of the values in the specified value list violates the uniqueness constraint. Alternatively, if the INSERT statement contains a subquery, the object table contents addressed by that subquery must be matched against the object table contents to determine the cause of the problem.  Note that if the table is protected using a security policy, your LBAC credentials may not allow you to see the rows that are causing the error. If the index is on an XML column and the statement is either INSERT or UPDATE, consider whether the XML document would result in duplicate values from within the single XML document.

The SQL statement cannot be processed. Modify the application program so there is no attempt to access an object within the same unit of work in which the modification was made. In general, it is better to isolate Data Definition Language (DDL) statements in a different unit of work than Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that access the same objects. The unit of work must be committed or rolled back before the statement that failed can be processed successfully. If the committed modification caused an object to be dropped, then the object may have to be recreated in order for the failing SQL statement to be processed successfully. If the object is modified within a SAVEPOINT, modify the application  program so that it does not attempt to access the object after  the application issues a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement. Any cursor that accesses the modified object and is open at the time of the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT will not be accessible. Modify the application so that it closes the cursor. If an insert, delete or update statement involving a NOT LOGGED created temporary table or declared temporary table fails, then all rows in that table are  deleted.

The request was holding a table lock that was needed for the rebuild.  The transaction was rolled back. The application was rolled back to the previous COMMIT.

To help avoid deadlock or lock timeout, issue frequent COMMIT operations, if possible, for a long-running application, or for an application likely to encounter a deadlock. Federated system users: the deadlock can occur at the federated server or at the data source.  There is no mechanism to detect deadlocks that span data sources and potentially the federated system.  It is possible to identify the data source failing the request (refer to the problem determination guide to determine which data source is failing to process the SQL statement). Deadlocks are often normal or expected while processing certain combinations of SQL statements.  It is recommended that you design applications to avoid deadlocks to the extent possible. If a deadlock state was reached because of a queuing threshold such as the CONCURRENTDBCOORDACTIVITIES threshold, increase the value of the queuing threshold. If the deadlock state was reached because the application is waiting for resources governed by workload manager admission control, increase the resourceshare for the service class in which the last statement of the application was executing. To help avoid deadlocks involving resources governed by workload manager admission control, reduce the number of concurrently executing SQL statements in applications by closing SQL cursors when they are no longer needed. Retry the request if the catalog member is in the resynchronization state. The catalog member needs to resynchronize with the entire cluster before it can allow requests to be processed. Retry the request if the catalog member is performing a database update operation. Retry the request if it timed out waiting for indexes to be rebuilt.

If an archive log is used, then the file system has not provided space to contain a new log file. This message can also be returned when the database has used almost all of the possible log sequence numbers.  The database manager identifies database log records using a unique identifier, called a log sequence number (LSN). When transactions cause database logs to be written, the database uses new LSN values. The application cannot perform any transactions that cause the database to write log records. The statement cannot be processed. Execute a COMMIT or ROLLBACK on receipt of this message (SQLCODE) or retry the operation. If the database is being updated by concurrent applications, retry the operation.  Log space may be freed up when another application finishes a transaction. Issue more frequent commit operations. If your transactions are not committed, log space may be freed up when the transactions are committed.  When designing an application, consider when to commit the update transactions to prevent a log full condition. If deadlocks are occurring, check for them more frequently. This can be done by decreasing the database configuration parameter DLCHKTIME.  This will cause deadlocks to be detected and resolved sooner (by ROLLBACK) which will then free log space.

If heap-name is set to AUTOMATIC, increase the appl_memory database configuration setting, the database_memory database configuration settings, or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. Otherwise, modify the heap-name heap value to increase the heap size. The package cache and catalog cache have soft limits, and for these, you will need to increase the database_memory database configuration setting or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. If heap-name is set to BigSQL IO, the Big SQL Java reader and writer memory is exceeded (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError or java.lang.StackOverflowError).  In this case, the fenced mode process (FMP) managing the JVM is marked as unstable, and a new FMP is created to handle any new requests to the Big SQL Java reader and writer JVM.  If this error is being returned frequently, the system might not be configured properly to handle resource requirements.    The default maximum memory (-Xmx) for the Java reader and writer FMP is computed as a percentage of instance_memory, so this might need to be increased. Setting the database_memory database configuration parameter to AUTOMATIC directs the database manager to manage database memory automatically. To increase the application shared heap size, increase either the appl_memory database configuration setting,  or the instance_memory database manager configuration setting. When updating a configuration parameter, it is good practice to change the value by no more than 10% at a time until  the error condition is resolved. For example, suppose that heap-name is util_heap_sz and the database name is TORDB1. To update this database configuration parameter to 10000, run the following command: db2 update db cfg\n\t  for tordb1\n\t  using util_heap_sz 10000 Copy to clipboard To view a list of the database configuration parameters, use the  GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION command.

The transaction is: Running under a Distributed Transaction Processing environment (such as those from CICS or other transaction managers). Performing heuristic operations. Updating multiple nicknames within a federated database, where each updated nickname represents a different data source.  In this case, one of the data sources has failed during transaction processing. The reason code returned in this case is the reason for the failure at the data source, not the federated database. The possible reason codes (corresponding X/Open XA reason codes are shown in parenthesis) are: 01 - (XAER_ASYNC) asynchronous operation already outstanding. 02 - (XAER_RMERR) a resource manager error occurred in the transaction branch. 03 - (XAER_NOTA) the XID is not valid. 04 - (XAER_INVAL) invalid arguments were given. Possible subcodes are: 01 - xa_info pointer is invalid, eg. the XAOpen string is null. 02 - database name exceeds maximum length. 03 - username exceeds maximum length. 04 - password exceeds maximum length. 05 - username specified but not a password. 06 - password specified but not a username. 07 - too many parameters in the xa_info string. 08 - multiple xa_opens generate different RM ids for the same database name. 09 - database name not specified. 10 - invalid exe_type. 11 - the Sybase LRM name is not present in the xa_config file or the xa_config file does not exist. 05 - (XAER_PROTO) routine invoked in improper context. 06 - (XAER_RMFAIL) resource manager unavailable. 07 - (XAER_DUPID) the XID already exits. 08 - (XAER_OUTSIDE) RM doing work outside global transaction. 09 - registration (ax_reg) with the transaction manager failed. Possible subcodes are: 01 - Joining XID not found 02 - dynamic library specified in the tp_mon_name configuration parameter could not be loaded. 10 - attempted to start a different transaction while suspended. 12 - unregistering (ax_unreg) with the transaction manager failed. 13 - ax interface failure: ax_reg() and ax_unreg() not found. 14 - The enlistment with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator has failed.  MSDTC service may be down. You must terminate the current transaction. 15 - The transaction does not exist. 16 - A failure occurred with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). Possible subcodes are: 01 - The database manager is unable to communicate with the MSDTC. 02 - The MSDTC is unable to register the connection. The subcode represents the Microsoft error code. 03 - MSDTC is unable to enlist the connection in the Distributed Transaction. The subcode represents the Microsoft error code. 04 - The connection cannot be enlisted as there is an active transaction. 05 - No transaction exists. The connection has not been enlisted. 35 - Heuristic operations are invalid for non-XA database. 36 - The XID is not known by the database manager. 37 - The transaction has already been heuristically committed. 38 - The transaction has already been heuristically rolled back. 39 - The transaction is not an indoubt transaction. 40 - Only rollbacks are allowed for this transaction. 41 - Transaction is not heuristically committed on some MPP subordinator nodes because of node failure. 42 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to outbound connections that were established using TCPIP. 43 - A connection could not be established because the server does not support native XA. 69 - Database log ID mismatch during DUOW resynchronization. 85 - As a result of heuristic processing, the transaction has partially committed and rolled back. 210 - Only heuristic commits are allowed for this transaction. Some nodes are already in commit state. 221 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database. 222 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate the same XA transaction have the same CCSID. 223 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to local clients or remote clients that use TCPIP to establish the inbound connection. 224 - DB2 Connect XA support is only available to clients that are at  least version 7.1. 225 - Operation Invalid in an XA Loosely Coupled Transaction. Possible subcodes are: 01 - DDL statements are not allowed. 02 - updates and deletes specifying WHERE CURRENT OF clause are not allowed. 03 - buffered insert operations are not allowed. 04 - only rollbacks are allowed for this transaction. 05 - implicit rebind operations are not allowed. 226 - The transaction has already been rolled back. 227 - Heuristic request should be run on the coordinator node. 228 - There are open cursors. 229 - The previous transaction is not yet complete. 230 - The transaction has already been committed. For reason codes 1 through 8, an entry will be made in the system log because sometimes the SQLCA cannot be returned to the caller. If the error is due to a failed data source associated with a nickname, the location of the failed data source will always appear in federated server's system log. For reason code 4, verify the content of the xa open string and make necessary corrections. For reason code 4, subcode 11, ensure xa_config file exists in $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS directory and the LRM name that is specified as the NODE server option exists in the file. For reason code 9, subcode 02, ensure that the tp_mon_name configuration parameter contains the name of the dynamic library in the external product which has the ax_reg() function used for dynamic registration of transactions. For reason code 14, ensure that the MSDTC service is active. For reason code 15, this error may occur when the MSDTC transaction timeout value is too low. Increase the timeout value and see if the error continues. For reason code 16: subcode 01, ensure that the MSDTC service is active. subcode 02, MSDTC was unable to register the connection. For more information refer to the db2diag log file or the Windows Event Viewer for an entry titled MicrosoftXARMCreate. subcode 03, MSDTC was unable to enlist the connection into a Transaction. For more information refer to the db2diag log file or the Windows Event Viewer for an entry titled MicrosoftEnlishWithRM. The most common error is that the current transaction has been explicitly or implicitly rolled back. This may occur when the MSDTC transaction timeout is too low. Increase the timeout value and see if the error continues. subcode 04, there has been an attempt to enlist a connection that is currently active in a different distributed transaction. subcode 05, enlist the connection before attempting to issue an SQL statement. For reason code 35, you attempted to perform a heuristic operation against a database that only participates as a read-only resource manager in a global transaction.  Examples are any DRDA databases such as DB2 on MVS. These type of non-XA databases would not have any XA indoubt transactions. For reason codes 36, 37, and 38, you attempted to perform an invalid heuristic operation on an indoubt transaction. Either you specified the wrong XID, or a heuristic or resync operation had taken place since you recorded this XID. Perform a Heuristic Query request to get the current list of indoubt transactions to verify if you still need to perform your heuristic operation. For reason code 39, the XID specified is for a transaction that has ended and is waiting for the two-phase commit process to begin. You can only perform heuristic operations on transactions that have entered the two-phase commit process and become indoubt transactions. For reason code 40, an SQL statement was attempted under a transaction which has failed.  An example of this is to attempt an SQL statement in a transaction thread that has successfully registered after a tightly coupled thread participating in the same transaction has abnormally terminated. For reason code 41, you can find more information about the problem in the administration notification log. You need to restart the database manager on the failed nodes. It may be necessary to contact the system administrator for assistance. For reason code 42, an outbound connection can be established by modifying the gateway catalogs to use TCPIP communication protocol. For reason code 43, if connecting to DB2 for z/OS server or DB2 for i server, catalog the database using DB2 Connect and then start the sync point manager. For reason code 69, either the transaction manager (TM) database or the resource manager (RM) database or both are different from the ones when the indoubt transaction was generated. In other words, the TM database or RM database names could be referencing different database instances. The log ID mismatch may be caused by the following reasons: The database directory for the TM database at the RM instance is incorrect. The configuration may have been changed after the indoubt transaction was generated. The database may have been dropped and recreated. In that case, you can only commit or rollback the indoubt transaction heuristically. For reason code 85, you are updating multiple data sources, and some of the data sources have been heuristically rolled back or committed, resulting in the transaction having partially committed and rolled back.  With this reason code data is now in an inconsistent state, you must manually check every data source updated by the transaction to correct the data. For reason code 210, some of the nodes are already in commit state. You have to perform heuristic commit to resolve the indoubt transaction. For reason code 221, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database. For reason code 222, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction have the same CCSID. For reason code 223, modify the application and client set-up to use local clients, or for remote clients use TCPIP as the communication protocol to connect to the gateway. For reason code 224, update the client to version 7.1 or later. For reason code 225, ensure the application did not contain any of the invalid operations in an XA Loosely Coupled Transaction. Common application server environments where XA Loosely Coupled Transaction can be used are IBM Encina Transaction Server, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and BEA Tuxedo. If you encounter this reason code, then you must review your application and ensure none of the indicated actions are performed. For reason code 226, the transaction has reached a rollback state, and is now rolled back on this node. For reason code 227, heuristic request should be run on the coordinator node, see the db2diag log file for the coordinator node number. For reason code 228, ensure that the cursors are closed prior to issuing the request. For reason code 229, ensure that the previous transaction is complete prior to issuing the request. For reason code 230, the transaction has already been committed. General information collection procedure: If you cannot resolve the problem identified by the reason codes, record the message number (SQLCODE), reason code, and the optional subcode in the message or the SQLCA in the system log. If the failure is from a federated database, you should also record the location of the failed data source found in the federated server's system log. If trace was active, invoke the Independent Trace Facility at the operating system command prompt. Then, contact your technical service representative with the following information: Problem description SQLCODE, embedded reason code, and subcode SQLCA contents (if possible) Trace file (if possible) Location of the failed data source if the failure is from a federated server. There might be additional information in the console or message logs of the transaction manager and the database manager. sqlcode :  -998 sqlstate :  58005"}]}
