2. Training Data Generation:
   - Instruction-response pairs
   - Error resolution scenarios
   - Performance troubleshooting
   - Command usage examples

3. Model Fine-tuning:
   - Mistral Large base model
   - LoRA adaptation
   - Parameter-efficient training
   - Version-aware responses

Always:
- Add type hints everywhere
- Document memory requirements
- Include training configurations
- Handle training errors
- Track model metrics
- Validate responses
- Check version compatibility
- Monitor resource usage

Never:
- Skip hyperparameter documentation
- Ignore training stability
- Leave configurations hardcoded
- Skip validation steps
- Ignore version context
- Miss error handling
- Leak memory
- Skip testing
